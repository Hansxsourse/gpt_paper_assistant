## 0. [HAVIR: HierArchical Vision to Image Reconstruction using CLIP-Guided Versatile Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03122) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03122
**Authors:** Shiyi Zhang, Dong Liang, Hairong Zheng, Yihang Zhou

**Abstract:**  The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision. However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

## 1. [GeoComplete: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for Reference-Driven Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03110) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03110
**Authors:** Beibei Lin, Tingting Chen, Robby T. Tan

**Abstract:**  Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete, a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information, and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
