## 0. [CDG-MAE: Learning Correspondences from Diffusion Generated Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18164) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2506.18164
**Authors:** Varun Belagali, Pierre Marza, Srikar Yellapragada, Zilinghan Li, Tarak Nath Nandi, Ravi K Madduri, Joel Saltz, Stergios Christodoulidis, Maria Vakalopoulou, Dimitris Samaras

**Abstract:**  Learning dense correspondences, critical for application such as video label propagation, is hindered by tedious and unscalable manual annotation. Self-supervised methods address this by using a cross-view pretext task, often modeled with a masked autoencoder, where a masked target view is reconstructed from an anchor view. However, acquiring effective training data remains a challenge - collecting diverse video datasets is difficult and costly, while simple image crops lack necessary pose variations. This paper introduces CDG-MAE, a novel MAE-based self-supervised method that uses diverse synthetic views generated from static images via an image-conditioned diffusion model. These generated views exhibit substantial changes in pose and perspective, providing a rich training signal that overcomes the limitations of video and crop-based anchors. We present a quantitative method to evaluate local and global consistency of generated images, discussing their use for cross-view self-supervised pretraining. Furthermore, we enhance the standard single-anchor MAE setting to a multi-anchor strategy to effectively modulate the difficulty of pretext task. CDG-MAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MAE methods reliant only on images and substantially narrows the performance gap to video-based approaches.

## 1. [Vision as a Dialect: Unifying Visual Understanding and Generation via Text-Aligned Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18898) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2506.18898
**Authors:** Jiaming Han, Hao Chen, Yang Zhao, Hanyu Wang, Qi Zhao, Ziyan Yang, Hao He, Xiangyu Yue, Lu Jiang

**Abstract:**  This paper presents a multimodal framework that attempts to unify visual understanding and generation within a shared discrete semantic representation. At its core is the Text-Aligned Tokenizer (TA-Tok), which converts images into discrete tokens using a text-aligned codebook projected from a large language model's (LLM) vocabulary. By integrating vision and text into a unified space with an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input and output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific designs. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to balance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to produce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we utilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a diffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced pre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses existing multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater training efficiency.

## 2. [Time-Contrastive Pretraining for In-Context Image and Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17837) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2506.17837
**Authors:** Assefa Wahd, Jacob Jaremko, Abhilash Hareendranathan

**Abstract:**  In-context learning (ICL) enables generalization to new tasks with minimal labeled data. However, mainstream ICL approaches rely on a gridding strategy, which lacks the flexibility required for vision applications. We introduce Temporal, a time-contrastive self-supervised objective that pretrains a prompt retriever for visual ICL, and formulate ICL as a video object segmentation (VOS) task. Temporal addresses key limitations of grid-based methods that restrict the number and resolution of context images. By reframing ICL as a VOS problem, our approach supports a variable number of context images while preserving their full resolution. To address the challenge of selecting optimal context sets for queries, we pretrain a prompt retriever on videos via self-supervised learning, where adjacent frames serve as positives and distant frames as negatives. For image segmentation, the prompt retriever selects relevant sequences that, when combined with the query, form coherent videos for VOS processing. For video segmentation, it identifies keyframes, predicts their masks using our ICL pipeline, and propagates them throughout the sequence. When evaluated on MICCAI FLARE 2022, our method achieves substantial improvements over baselines: 90.95% Dice score for image segmentation (10.64% improvement) and 92.45% Dice for video segmentation (14.88% improvement).

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
