        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.06957v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce a generalizable and unified framework to synthesize view-consistent and temporally coherent avatars from a single image, addressing the challenging problem of single-image avatar generation. While recent methods employ diffusion models conditioned on human templates like depth or normal maps, they often struggle to preserve appearance information due to the discrepancy between sparse driving signals and the actual human subject, resulting in multi-view and temporal inconsistencies. Our approach bridges this gap by combining the reconstruction power of regression-based 3D human reconstruction with the generative capabilities of a diffusion model. The dense driving signal from the initial reconstructed human provides comprehensive conditioning, ensuring high-quality synthesis faithful to the reference appearance and structure. Additionally, we propose a unified framework that enables the generalization learned from novel pose synthesis on in-the-wild videos to naturally transfer to novel view synthesis. Our video-based diffusion model enhances disentangled synthesis with high-quality view-consistent renderings for novel views and realistic non-rigid deformations in novel pose animation. Results demonstrate the superior generalization ability of our method across in-domain and out-of-domain in-the-wild datasets. Project page: https://humansensinglab.github.io/GAS/",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07003v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Astronauts take thousands of photos of Earth per day from the International Space Station, which, once localized on Earth's surface, are used for a multitude of tasks, ranging from climate change research to disaster management. The localization process, which has been performed manually for decades, has recently been approached through image retrieval solutions: given an astronaut photo, find its most similar match among a large database of geo-tagged satellite images, in a task called Astronaut Photography Localization (APL). Yet, existing APL approaches are trained only using satellite images, without taking advantage of the millions open-source astronaut photos. In this work we present the first APL pipeline capable of leveraging astronaut photos for training. We first produce full localization information for 300,000 manually weakly labeled astronaut photos through an automated pipeline, and then use these images to train a model, called AstroLoc. AstroLoc learns a robust representation of Earth's surface features through two losses: astronaut photos paired with their matching satellite counterparts in a pairwise loss, and a second loss on clusters of satellite imagery weighted by their relevance to astronaut photography via unsupervised mining. We find that AstroLoc achieves a staggering 35% average improvement in recall@1 over previous SOTA, pushing the limits of existing datasets with a recall@100 consistently over 99%. Finally, we note that AstroLoc, without any fine-tuning, provides excellent results for related tasks like the lost-in-space satellite problem and historical space imagery localization.",

Recent methods attempt to achieve this by learning a 3D occupancy world model that forecasts future surrounding scenes based on current observation. However, 3D occupancy labels are still required to produce promising results. Considering the high annotation cost for 3D outdoor scenes, we propose a semi-supervised vision-centric 3D occupancy world model, PreWorld, to leverage the potential of 2D labels through a novel two-stage training paradigm: the self-supervised pre-training stage and the fully-supervised fine-tuning stage. Specifically, during the pre-training stage, we utilize an attribute projection head to generate different attribute fields of a scene (e.g., RGB, density, semantic), thus enabling temporal supervision from 2D labels via volume rendering techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective state-conditioned forecasting module to recursively forecast future occupancy and ego trajectory in a direct manner. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method, and demonstrate that PreWorld achieves competitive performance across 3D occupancy prediction, 4D occupancy forecasting and motion planning tasks.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07601v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) is an emerging AD paradigm. Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning. Extensions to medical and 3D AD are provided for future study. The link to our project page: https://xujiacong.github.io/Anomaly-OV/",

When such autotelic exploration is achieved by LLM agents trained with online RL in high-dimensional and evolving goal spaces, a key challenge for LP prediction is modeling one's own competence, a form of metacognitive monitoring. Traditional approaches either require extensive sampling or rely on brittle expert-defined goal groupings. We introduce MAGELLAN, a metacognitive framework that lets LLM agents learn to predict their competence and LP online. By capturing semantic relationships between goals, MAGELLAN enables sample-efficient LP estimation and dynamic adaptation to evolving goal spaces through generalization. In an interactive learning environment, we show that MAGELLAN improves LP prediction efficiency and goal prioritization, being the only method allowing the agent to fully master a large and evolving goal space. These results demonstrate how augmenting LLM agents with a metacognitive ability for LP predictions can effectively scale curriculum learning to open-ended goal spaces.",

However, its optimization process lacks explicit geometric constraints, leading to suboptimal geometric reconstruction in regions with sparse or no observational input views. In this work, we try to mitigate the issue by incorporating a pre-trained matching prior to the 3DGS optimization process. We introduce Flow Distillation Sampling (FDS), a technique that leverages pre-trained geometric knowledge to bolster the accuracy of the Gaussian radiance field. Our method employs a strategic sampling technique to target unobserved views adjacent to the input views, utilizing the optical flow calculated from the matching model (Prior Flow) to guide the flow analytically calculated from the 3DGS geometry (Radiance Flow). Comprehensive experiments in depth rendering, mesh reconstruction, and novel view synthesis showcase the significant advantages of FDS over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our interpretive experiments and analysis aim to shed light on the effects of FDS on geometric accuracy and rendering quality, potentially providing readers with insights into its performance.

Specifically, the text input allows us to tap into the power of modern-day video diffusion to generate plausible motion samples for the right object category and part. In turn, the input 3D object provides image prompting to personalize the generated video to that very object we wish to articulate. Our method starts with a few-shot finetuning for category-specific motion generation, a key first step to compensate for the lack of articulation awareness by current video diffusion models. For this, we finetune a pre-trained multi-view image generation model for controllable multi-view video generation, using a small collection of video samples obtained for the target object category. This is followed by motion video personalization that is realized by multi-view rendered images of the target 3D object. At last, we transfer the personalized video motion to the target 3D object via differentiable rendering to optimize part motion parameters by a score distillation sampling loss. We show that our method is capable of generating realistic motion videos and predict 3D motion parameters in a more accurate and generalizable way, compared to prior works.",

Despite recent progressive, existing methods often struggle to handle severe object appearance changes and cluttering background in the video due to lacking sufficient target cues, leading to degradation. Addressing this, we introduce PRVQL, a novel Progressive knowledge-guided Refinement framework for EgoVQL. The core is to continuously exploit target-relevant knowledge directly from videos and utilize it as guidance to refine both query and video features for improving target localization. Our PRVQL contains multiple processing stages. The target knowledge from one stage, comprising appearance and spatial knowledge extracted via two specially designed knowledge learning modules, are utilized as guidance to refine the query and videos features for the next stage, which are used to generate more accurate knowledge for further feature refinement. With such a progressive process, target knowledge in PRVQL can be gradually improved, which, in turn, leads to better refined query and video features for localization in the final stage. Compared to previous methods, our PRVQL, besides the given object cues, enjoys additional crucial target information from a video as guidance to refine features, and hence enhances EgoVQL in complicated scenes. In our experiments on challenging Ego4D, PRVQL achieves state-of-the-art result and largely surpasses other methods, showing its efficacy.

Such a task is non-trivial due to the large entanglement of material appearance, geometry, and lighting in a photograph. In the literature, material editing methods typically rely on either cumbersome text engineering or extensive manual annotations requiring artist knowledge and 3D scene properties that are impractical to obtain. In contrast, we propose to directly learn the relationship between the input material -- as observed on a flat surface -- and its appearance within the scene, without the need for explicit UV mapping. To achieve this, we rely on a custom light- and geometry-aware diffusion model. We fine-tune a large-scale pre-trained text-to-image model for material transfer using our synthetic dataset, preserving its strong priors to ensure effective generalization to real images. As a result, our method seamlessly integrates a desired material into the target location in the photograph while retaining the identity of the scene. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real images and show that it compares favorably to recent work both qualitatively and quantitatively. We will release our code and data upon publication.",

We pre-train Pippo on 3B human images without captions, and conduct multi-view mid-training and post-training on studio captured humans. During mid-training, to quickly absorb the studio dataset, we denoise several (up to 48) views at low-resolution, and encode target cameras coarsely using a shallow MLP. During post-training, we denoise fewer views at high-resolution and use pixel-aligned controls (e.g., Spatial anchor and Plucker rays) to enable 3D consistent generations. At inference, we propose an attention biasing technique that allows Pippo to simultaneously generate greater than 5 times as many views as seen during training.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07737v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Next-Token Prediction (NTP) is a de facto approach for autoregressive (AR) video generation, but it suffers from suboptimal unidirectional dependencies and slow inference speed. In this work, we propose a semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) framework, called Next-Block Prediction (NBP), for video generation. By uniformly decomposing video content into equal-sized blocks (e.g., rows or frames), we shift the generation unit from individual tokens to blocks, allowing each token in the current block to simultaneously predict the corresponding token in the next block. Unlike traditional AR modeling, our framework employs bidirectional attention within each block, enabling tokens to capture more robust spatial dependencies. By predicting multiple tokens in parallel, NBP models significantly reduce the number of generation steps, leading to faster and more efficient inference. Our model achieves FVD scores of 103.3 on UCF101 and 25.5 on K600, outperforming the vanilla NTP model by an average of 4.4. Furthermore, thanks to the reduced number of inference steps, the NBP model generates 8.89 frames (128x128 resolution) per second, achieving an 11x speedup. We also explored model scales ranging from 700M to 3B parameters, observing significant improvements in generation quality, with FVD scores dropping from 103.3 to 55.3 on UCF101 and from 25.5 to 19.5 on K600, demonstrating the scalability of our approach.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.06894v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial and spectral data, enabling analysis of features invisible to conventional systems. The technology is vital in fields such as weather monitoring, food quality control, counterfeit detection, healthcare diagnostics, and extending into defense, agriculture, and industrial automation at the same time. HSI has advanced with improvements in spectral resolution, miniaturization, and computational methods. This study provides an overview of the HSI, its applications, challenges in data fusion and the role of deep learning models in processing HSI data. We discuss how integration of multimodal HSI with AI, particularly with deep learning, improves classification accuracy and operational efficiency. Deep learning enhances HSI analysis in areas like feature extraction, change detection, denoising unmixing, dimensionality reduction, landcover mapping, data augmentation, spectral construction and super resolution. An emerging focus is the fusion of hyperspectral cameras with large language models (LLMs), referred as highbrain LLMs, enabling the development of advanced applications such as low visibility crash detection and face antispoofing. We also highlight key players in HSI industry, its compound annual growth rate and the growing industrial significance.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07409v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Whole slide pathology image classification presents challenges due to gigapixel image sizes and limited annotation labels, hindering model generalization. This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP.

These methods face sustainability challenges due to the diversity of pathologies and the labor-intensive nature of data collection. To address these limitations, we highlight the need for universal multimodal embeddings that can support multiple downstream tasks. Previous approaches often involve fine-tuning CLIP-based models, which handle images and text separately, limiting their ability to capture complex multimodal relationships. Additionally, these models are evaluated across diverse datasets without a unified benchmark for assessing multimodal embeddings in pathology. To address these challenges, we propose MLLM4PUE, a novel framework that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate Pathology Universal Embeddings. The MLLM4PUE framework not only facilitates robust integration of images and text but also enhances understanding and fusion capabilities across various tasks. We further introduce the Pathology Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (PMEB), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the quality of pathology multimodal embeddings. PMEB comprises 15 original tasks drawn from 14 datasets, organized into three meta-tasks: retrieval, classification, and composed retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MLLM4PUE, illustrating MLLM-based models can effectively support a wide range of downstream tasks and unify the research direction for foundation models in pathology.",

However, current ZS-CIR approaches face three critical limitations in their reliance on composed text embeddings: static query embedding representations, insufficient utilization of image embeddings, and suboptimal performance when fusing text and image embeddings. To address these challenges, we introduce the Prompt Directional Vector (PDV), a simple yet effective training-free enhancement that captures semantic modifications induced by user prompts. PDV enables three key improvements: (1) dynamic composed text embeddings where prompt adjustments are controllable via a scaling factor, (2) composed image embeddings through semantic transfer from text prompts to image features, and (3) weighted fusion of composed text and image embeddings that enhances retrieval by balancing visual and semantic similarity. Our approach serves as a plug-and-play enhancement for existing ZS-CIR methods with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PDV consistently improves retrieval performance when integrated with state-of-the-art ZS-CIR approaches, particularly for methods that generate accurate compositional embeddings.

The key idea is simple: factorize the text-to-video generation task into two separate easier tasks for diffusion step distillation, namely text-to-image generation and image-to-video generation. We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification. With those techniques, we are able to generate 5-second video clips within 3 seconds. By applying a test time sliding window, we are able to generate a minute-long video within one minute with significantly improved visual quality and motion dynamics, spending less than 1 second for generating 1 second video clips on average. We conduct a series of preliminary explorations to find out the optimal tradeoff between computational cost and video quality during diffusion step distillation and hope this could be a good foundation model for open-source explorations.

The system's foundation is built on our Hierarchical Task DAG (HTDAG) framework, which dynamically decomposes high-level objectives into manageable sub-tasks while rigorously maintaining dependencies and execution coherence. Deep Agent advances beyond traditional agent systems through three key innovations: First, it implements a recursive two-stage planner-executor architecture that enables continuous task refinement and adaptation as circumstances change. Second, it features an Autonomous API & Tool Creation (AATC) system that automatically generates reusable components from UI interactions, substantially reducing operational costs for similar tasks. Third, it incorporates Prompt Tweaking Engine and Autonomous Prompt Feedback Learning components that optimize Large Language Model prompts for specific scenarios, enhancing both inference accuracy and operational stability. These components are integrated to form a service infrastructure that manages user contexts, handles complex task dependencies, and orchestrates end-to-end agentic workflow execution.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07466v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Given a style-reference image as the additional image condition, text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating images that possess the content of text prompts while adopting the visual style of the reference image. However, current state-of-the-art methods often struggle to disentangle content and style from style-reference images, leading to issues such as content leakages. To address this issue, we propose a masking-based method that efficiently decouples content from style without the need of tuning any model parameters. By simply masking specific elements in the style reference's image features, we uncover a critical yet under-explored principle: guiding with appropriately-selected fewer conditions (e.g., dropping several image feature elements) can efficiently avoid unwanted content flowing into the diffusion models, enhancing the style transfer performances of text-to-image diffusion models. In this paper, we validate this finding both theoretically and experimentally. Extensive experiments across various styles demonstrate the effectiveness of our masking-based method and support our theoretical results.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07160v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image compression under ultra-low bitrates remains challenging for both conventional learned image compression (LIC) and generative vector-quantized (VQ) modeling. Conventional LIC suffers from severe artifacts due to heavy quantization, while generative VQ modeling gives poor fidelity due to the mismatch between learned generative priors and specific inputs. In this work, we propose Hybrid-Diffusion Image Compression (HDCompression), a dual-stream framework that utilizes both generative VQ-modeling and diffusion models, as well as conventional LIC, to achieve both high fidelity and high perceptual quality. Different from previous hybrid methods that directly use pre-trained LIC models to generate low-quality fidelity-preserving information from heavily quantized latent, we use diffusion models to extract high-quality complimentary fidelity information from the ground-truth input, which can enhance the system performance in several aspects: improving indices map prediction, enhancing the fidelity-preserving output of the LIC stream, and refining conditioned image reconstruction with VQ-latent correction. In addition, our diffusion model is based on a dense representative vector (DRV), which is lightweight with very simple sampling schedulers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HDCompression outperforms the previous conventional LIC, generative VQ-modeling, and hybrid frameworks in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualization, providing balanced robust compression performance at ultra-low bitrates.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07266v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Researchers have been exploring ways to guide models to generate more complex CoT processes to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs, such as long CoT and the test-time scaling law. However, for most models and tasks, does an increase in CoT length consistently lead to improved reasoning accuracy? In this paper, we observe a nuanced relationship: as the number of reasoning steps increases, performance initially improves but eventually decreases. To understand this phenomenon, we provide a piece of evidence that longer reasoning processes are increasingly susceptible to noise. We theoretically prove the existence of an optimal CoT length and derive a scaling law for this optimal length based on model capability and task difficulty. Inspired by our theory, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets and propose Length-filtered Vote to alleviate the effects of excessively long or short CoTs. Our findings highlight the critical need to calibrate CoT length to align with model capabilities and task demands, offering a principled framework for optimizing multi-step reasoning in LLMs.",

To address these challenges, we introduce Contextual Gesture, a framework that improves co-speech gesture video generation through three innovative components: (1) a chronological speech-gesture alignment that temporally connects two modalities, (2) a contextualized gesture tokenization that incorporate speech context into motion pattern representation through distillation, and (3) a structure-aware refinement module that employs edge connection to link gesture keypoints to improve video generation.

        "title": "LLMs Can Easily Learn to Reason from Demonstrations Structure, not content, is what matters!",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07374v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) tackle complex reasoning problems by following long chain-of-thoughts (Long CoT) that incorporate reflection, backtracking, and self-validation. However, the training techniques and data requirements to elicit Long CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we find that a Large Language model (LLM) can effectively learn Long CoT reasoning through data-efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA). With just 17k long CoT training samples, the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model achieves significant improvements on a wide range of math and coding benchmarks, including 56.7% (+40.0%) on AIME 2024 and 57.0% (+8.1%) on LiveCodeBench, competitive to the proprietary o1-preview model's score of 44.6% and 59.1%. More importantly, we find that the structure of Long CoT is critical to the learning process, whereas the content of individual reasoning steps has minimal impact. Perturbations affecting content, such as training on incorrect samples or removing reasoning keywords, have little impact on performance. In contrast, structural modifications that disrupt logical consistency in the Long CoT, such as shuffling or deleting reasoning steps, significantly degrade accuracy. For example, a model trained on Long CoT samples with incorrect answers still achieves only 3.2% lower accuracy compared to training with fully correct samples. These insights deepen our understanding of how to elicit reasoning capabilities in LLMs and highlight key considerations for efficiently training the next generation of reasoning models.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07246v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fingerprint localization has gained significant attention due to its cost-effective deployment, low complexity, and high efficacy. However, traditional methods, while effective for static data, often struggle in dynamic environments where data distributions and feature spaces evolve-a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. To address the challenges of robustness and adaptability in fingerprint localization for dynamic indoor environments, this paper proposes DF-Loc, an end-to-end dynamic fingerprint localization system based on multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MUDA). DF-Loc leverages historical data from multiple time scales to facilitate knowledge transfer in specific feature spaces, thereby enhancing generalization capabilities in the target domain and reducing reliance on labeled data. Specifically, the system incorporates a Quality Control (QC) module for CSI data preprocessing and employs image processing techniques for CSI fingerprint feature reconstruction. Additionally, a multi-scale attention-based feature fusion backbone network is designed to extract multi-level transferable fingerprint features. Finally, a dual-stage alignment model aligns the distributions of multiple source-target domain pairs, improving regression characteristics in the target domain. Extensive experiments conducted in office and classroom environments demonstrate that DF-Loc outperforms comparative methods in terms of both localization accuracy and robustness. With 60% of reference points used for training, DF-Loc achieves average localization errors of 0.79m and 3.72m in \"same-test\" scenarios, and 0.94m and 4.39m in \"different-test\" scenarios, respectively.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07331v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Manual segmentation is labor-intensive, and automatic segmentation remains challenging due to the inherent variability in meniscal morphology, partial volume effects, and low contrast between the meniscus and surrounding tissues. To address these challenges, we propose ERANet, an innovative semi-supervised framework for meniscus segmentation that effectively leverages both labeled and unlabeled images through advanced augmentation and learning strategies. ERANet integrates three key components: edge replacement augmentation (ERA), prototype consistency alignment (PCA), and a conditional self-training (CST) strategy within a mean teacher architecture. ERA introduces anatomically relevant perturbations by simulating meniscal variations, ensuring that augmentations align with the structural context. PCA enhances segmentation performance by aligning intra-class features and promoting compact, discriminative feature representations, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. CST improves segmentation robustness by iteratively refining pseudo-labels and mitigating the impact of label noise during training. Together, these innovations establish ERANet as a robust and scalable solution for meniscus segmentation, effectively addressing key barriers to practical implementation. We validated ERANet comprehensively on 3D Double Echo Steady State (DESS) and 3D Fast/Turbo Spin Echo (FSE/TSE) MRI sequences. The results demonstrate the superior performance of ERANet compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed framework achieves reliable and accurate segmentation of meniscus structures, even when trained on minimal labeled data. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the synergistic contributions of ERA, PCA, and CST, solidifying ERANet as a transformative solution for semi-supervised meniscus segmentation in medical imaging.",

The degradation compromises the accuracy and reliability of these systems across various scenarios. To tackle the challenge of developing adaptable models for scene restoration, we introduce the unified scene recovery network (USRNet), capable of handling multiple types of image degradation. The USRNet features a sophisticated architecture consisting of a scene encoder, an attention-driven node independent learning mechanism (NILM), an edge decoder, and a scene restoration module. The scene encoder, powered by advanced residual blocks, extracts deep features from degraded images in a progressive manner, ensuring thorough encoding of degradation information. To enhance the USRNet's adaptability in diverse weather conditions, we introduce NILM, which enables the network to learn and respond to different scenarios with precision, thereby increasing its robustness. The edge decoder is designed to extract edge features with precision, which is essential for maintaining image sharpness. Experimental results demonstrate that USRNet surpasses existing methods in handling complex imaging degradations, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of visual systems across diverse scenarios.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07191v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), solving complex reasoning tasks has gained increasing attention. Inference-time computation methods (e.g., Best-of-N, beam search, et al.) are particularly valuable as they can enhance reasoning performance without modifying model parameters or requiring additional training. However, these techniques come with implementation challenges, and most existing methods remain at the proof-of-concept stage with limited practical adoption due to their computational complexity and varying effectiveness across different tasks. In this paper, we investigate and benchmark diverse inference-time computation strategies across reasoning tasks of varying complexity. Since most current methods rely on a proposer-verifier pipeline that first generates candidate solutions (e.g., reasoning solutions) and then selects the best one based on reward signals (e.g., RLHF rewards, process rewards), our research focuses on optimizing both candidate solution generation (e.g., instructing prompts, hyperparameters such as temperature and top-p) and reward mechanisms (e.g., self-evaluation, reward types). Through extensive experiments (more than 20,000 A100-80G GPU hours with over 1,000 experiments) across a variety of models (e.g., Llama, Qwen, and Mistral families) of various sizes, our ablation studies reveal that previously overlooked strategies can significantly enhance performance (e.g., tuning temperature can improve reasoning task performance by up to 5%). Furthermore, we establish a standardized benchmark for inference-time computation by systematically evaluating six representative methods across eight reasoning tasks.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07225v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Latent diffusion models have recently demonstrated superior capabilities in many downstream image synthesis tasks. However, customization of latent diffusion models using unauthorized data can severely compromise the privacy and intellectual property rights of data owners. Adversarial examples as protective perturbations have been developed to defend against unauthorized data usage by introducing imperceptible noise to customization samples, preventing diffusion models from effectively learning them. In this paper, we first reveal that the primary reason adversarial examples are effective as protective perturbations in latent diffusion models is the distortion of their latent representations, as demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative experiments. We then propose the Contrastive Adversarial Training (CAT) utilizing adapters as an adaptive attack against these protection methods, highlighting their lack of robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CAT method significantly reduces the effectiveness of protective perturbations in customization configurations, urging the community to reconsider and enhance the robustness of existing protective perturbation methods.

Building on this insight, we propose a novel semantic drift calibration method that incorporates mean shift compensation and covariance calibration. Specifically, we calculate each class's mean by averaging its sample embeddings and estimate task shifts using weighted embedding changes based on their proximity to the previous mean, effectively capturing mean shifts for all learned classes with each new task. We also apply Mahalanobis distance constraint for covariance calibration, aligning class-specific embedding covariances between old and current networks to mitigate the covariance shift. Additionally, we integrate a feature-level self-distillation approach to enhance generalization. Comprehensive experiments on commonly used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07526v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) aims to measure non-contact physiological signals from facial videos, which has shown great potential in many applications. Most existing methods directly extract video-based rPPG features by designing neural networks for heart rate estimation. Although they can achieve acceptable results, the recovery of rPPG signal faces intractable challenges when interference from real-world scenarios takes place on facial video. Specifically, facial videos are inevitably affected by non-physiological factors (e.g., camera device noise, defocus, and motion blur), leading to the distortion of extracted rPPG signals. Recent rPPG extraction methods are easily affected by interference and degradation, resulting in noisy rPPG signals. In this paper, we propose a novel method named CodePhys, which innovatively treats rPPG measurement as a code query task in a noise-free proxy space (i.e., codebook) constructed by ground-truth PPG signals. We consider noisy rPPG features as queries and generate high-fidelity rPPG features by matching them with noise-free PPG features from the codebook. Our approach also incorporates a spatial-aware encoder network with a spatial attention mechanism to highlight physiologically active areas and uses a distillation loss to reduce the influence of non-periodic visual interference. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CodePhys outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset settings.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07194v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Dense object detection is widely used in automatic driving, video surveillance, and other fields. This paper focuses on the challenging task of dense object detection. Currently, detection methods based on greedy algorithms, such as non-maximum suppression (NMS), often produce many repetitive predictions or missed detections in dense scenarios, which is a common problem faced by NMS-based algorithms. Through the end-to-end DETR (DEtection TRansformer), as a type of detector that can incorporate the post-processing de-duplication capability of NMS, etc., into the network, we found that homogeneous queries in the query-based detector lead to a reduction in the de-duplication capability of the network and the learning efficiency of the encoder, resulting in duplicate prediction and missed detection problems. To solve this problem, we propose learnable differentiated encoding to de-homogenize the queries, and at the same time, queries can communicate with each other via differentiated encoding information, replacing the previous self-attention among the queries. In addition, we used joint loss on the output of the encoder that considered both location and confidence prediction to give a higher-quality initialization for queries. Without cumbersome decoder stacking and guaranteeing accuracy, our proposed end-to-end detection framework was more concise and reduced the number of parameters by about 8% compared to deformable DETR. Our method achieved excellent results on the challenging CrowdHuman dataset with 93.6% average precision (AP), 39.2% MR-2, and 84.3% JI. The performance overperformed previous SOTA methods, such as Iter-E2EDet (Progressive End-to-End Object Detection) and MIP (One proposal, Multiple predictions). In addition, our method is more robust in various scenarios with different densities.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07644v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To govern smart contracts running on Ethereum, multiple Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) standards have been developed, each having a set of rules to guide the behaviors of smart contracts. Violating the ERC rules could cause serious security issues and financial loss, signifying the importance of verifying smart contracts follow ERCs. Today's practices of such verification are to manually audit each single contract, use expert-developed program-analysis tools, or use large language models (LLMs), all of which are far from effective in identifying ERC rule violations. This paper introduces SymGPT, a tool that combines the natural language understanding of large language models (LLMs) with the formal guarantees of symbolic execution to automatically verify smart contracts' compliance with ERC rules. To develop SymGPT, we conduct an empirical study of 132 ERC rules from three widely used ERC standards, examining their content, security implications, and natural language descriptions. Based on this study, we design SymGPT by first instructing an LLM to translate ERC rules into a defined EBNF grammar. We then synthesize constraints from the formalized rules to represent scenarios where violations may occur and use symbolic execution to detect them. Our evaluation shows that SymGPT identifies 5,783 ERC rule violations in 4,000 real-world contracts, including 1,375 violations with clear attack paths for stealing financial assets, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, SymGPT outperforms six automated techniques and a security-expert auditing service, underscoring its superiority over current smart contract analysis methods.",

In cognitive research, the latter ability is referred to as fluid intelligence, which is considered to be critical for assessing human intelligence. Recent research on fluid intelligence assessments has highlighted significant deficiencies in LLMs' abilities. In this paper, we analyze the challenges LLMs face in demonstrating fluid intelligence through controlled experiments, using the most representative ARC task as an example. Our study revealed three major limitations in existing LLMs: limited ability for skill composition, unfamiliarity with abstract input formats, and the intrinsic deficiency of left-to-right decoding.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.07663v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly intertwined with daily life, assisting users in executing various tasks and providing guidance on decision-making. This integration introduces risks of AI-driven manipulation, where such systems may exploit users' cognitive biases and emotional vulnerabilities to steer them toward harmful outcomes. Through a randomized controlled trial with 233 participants, we examined human susceptibility to such manipulation in financial (e.g., purchases) and emotional (e.g., conflict resolution) decision-making contexts. Participants interacted with one of three AI agents: a neutral agent (NA) optimizing for user benefit without explicit influence, a manipulative agent (MA) designed to covertly influence beliefs and behaviors, or a strategy-enhanced manipulative agent (SEMA) employing explicit psychological tactics to reach its hidden objectives. By analyzing participants' decision patterns and shifts in their preference ratings post-interaction, we found significant susceptibility to AI-driven manipulation. Particularly, across both decision-making domains, participants interacting with the manipulative agents shifted toward harmful options at substantially higher rates (financial, MA: 62.3%, SEMA: 59.6%; emotional, MA: 42.3%, SEMA: 41.5%) compared to the NA group (financial, 35.8%; emotional, 12.8%). Notably, our findings reveal that even subtle manipulative objectives (MA) can be as effective as employing explicit psychological strategies (SEMA) in swaying human decision-making. By revealing the potential for covert AI influence, this study highlights a critical vulnerability in human-AI interactions, emphasizing the need for ethical safeguards and regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible deployment of AI technologies and protect human autonomy.",

However, adverse imaging conditions such as haze during the day, low light, and haze at night severely degrade image quality, and complicating the SOD process. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-task-oriented nighttime haze imaging enhancer (MToIE), which integrates three tasks: daytime dehazing, low-light enhancement, and nighttime dehazing. The MToIE incorporates two key innovative components: First, the network employs a task-oriented node learning mechanism to handle three specific degradation types: day-time haze, low light, and night-time haze conditions, with an embedded self-attention module enhancing its performance in nighttime imaging. In addition, multi-receptive field enhancement module that efficiently extracts multi-scale features through three parallel depthwise separable convolution branches with different dilation rates, capturing comprehensive spatial information with minimal computational overhead. To ensure optimal image reconstruction quality and visual characteristics, we suggest a hybrid loss function.

However, training such models typically requires labor-intensive, pixel-wise annotations by domain experts. Recent efforts have democratized this process by involving lay annotators without medical expertise. However, conventional non-agent-based approaches struggle to handle annotation noise adaptively, as they lack mechanisms to mitigate false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) at both the image-feature and pixel levels. In this paper, we propose a consensus-aware self-corrective AI agent that leverages the Consensus Matrix to guide its learning process. The Consensus Matrix defines regions where both the AI and annotators agree on cell and non-cell annotations, which are prioritized with stronger supervision. Conversely, areas of disagreement are adaptively weighted based on their feature similarity to high-confidence agreement regions, with more similar regions receiving greater attention. Additionally, contrastive learning is employed to separate features of noisy regions from those of reliable agreement regions by maximizing their dissimilarity. This paradigm enables the AI to iteratively refine noisy labels, enhancing its robustness. Validated on one real-world lay-annotated cell dataset and two simulated noisy datasets, our method demonstrates improved segmentation performance, effectively correcting FP and FN errors and showcasing its potential for training robust models on noisy datasets.

Existing approaches mostly hinge on single-scale propagation strategies that iteratively ameliorate initial coarse depth estimates through pixel-level message passing. Despite their commendable outcomes, these techniques are frequently hampered by computational inefficiencies and a limited grasp of scene context. To circumvent these challenges, we introduce LP-Net, an innovative framework that implements a multi-scale, progressive prediction paradigm based on Laplacian Pyramid decomposition. Diverging from propagation-based approaches, LP-Net initiates with a rudimentary, low-resolution depth prediction to encapsulate the global scene context, subsequently refining this through successive upsampling and the reinstatement of high-frequency details at incremental scales. We have developed two novel modules to bolster this strategy: 1) the Multi-path Feature Pyramid module, which segregates feature maps into discrete pathways, employing multi-scale transformations to amalgamate comprehensive spatial information, and 2) the Selective Depth Filtering module, which dynamically learns to apply both smoothness and sharpness filters to judiciously mitigate noise while accentuating intricate details. By integrating these advancements, LP-Net not only secures state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across both outdoor and indoor benchmarks such as KITTI, NYUv2, and TOFDC, but also demonstrates superior computational efficiency.

In general, this adaptation is formulated as the minimum entropy problem. However, the minimum entropy problem has inherent limitation -- shifted initialization cascade phenomenon. We extend the relationship between the minimum entropy problem and the minimum set cover problem via Lebesgue integral. This extension reveals that internal mechanism of the minimum entropy problem ignores the relationship between disentangled representations, which leads to shifted initialization cascade. From the analysis, we introduce a new clustering algorithm, Union-find based Recursive Clustering Algorithm~(URECA). URECA is an efficient clustering algorithm for the leverage of the relationships between disentangled representations. The update rule of URECA depends on Thresholdly-Updatable Stationary Assumption to dynamics as a released version of Stationary Assumption. This assumption helps URECA to transport disentangled representations with no errors based on the relationships between disentangled representations. URECA also utilize simulation trick to efficiently cluster disentangled representations.
