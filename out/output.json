        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.00702v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present RayZer, a self-supervised multi-view 3D Vision model trained without any 3D supervision, i.e., camera poses and scene geometry, while exhibiting emerging 3D awareness. Concretely, RayZer takes unposed and uncalibrated images as input, recovers camera parameters, reconstructs a scene representation, and synthesizes novel views. During training, RayZer relies solely on its self-predicted camera poses to render target views, eliminating the need for any ground-truth camera annotations and allowing RayZer to be trained with 2D image supervision. The emerging 3D awareness of RayZer is attributed to two key factors. First, we design a self-supervised framework, which achieves 3D-aware auto-encoding of input images by disentangling camera and scene representations. Second, we design a transformer-based model in which the only 3D prior is the ray structure, connecting camera, pixel, and scene simultaneously. RayZer demonstrates comparable or even superior novel view synthesis performance than ``oracle'' methods that rely on pose annotations in both training and testing.

Current micromobility depends mostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises safety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of unpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in maneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation solution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a high-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied agents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules: Hierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation strategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity, realism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose URBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various capabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility. URBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents: Urban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots with heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across these tasks.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.00378v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D panoptic segmentation has recently emerged as a significant trend. Top-performing methods currently integrate 2D segmentation with geometry-aware 3D primitives. However, the advantage would be lost without high-fidelity 3D point clouds, such as methods based on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). These methods are limited by the insufficient capacity to maintain consistency across partial observations. To address this, recent works have utilized contrastive loss or cross-view association pre-processing for view consensus. In contrast to them, we present Cues3D, a compact approach that relies solely on NeRF instead of pre-associations. The core idea is that NeRF's implicit 3D field inherently establishes a globally consistent geometry, enabling effective object distinction without explicit cross-view supervision. We propose a three-phase training framework for NeRF, initialization-disambiguation-refinement, whereby the instance IDs are corrected using the initially-learned knowledge. Additionally, an instance disambiguation method is proposed to match NeRF-rendered 3D masks and ensure globally unique 3D instance identities. With the aid of Cues3D, we obtain highly consistent and unique 3D instance ID for each object across views with a balanced version of NeRF. Our experiments are conducted on ScanNet v2, ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and Replica datasets for 3D instance, panoptic, and semantic segmentation tasks. Cues3D outperforms other 2D image-based methods and competes with the latest 2D-3D merging based methods, while even surpassing them when using additional 3D point clouds.

However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%.",

By leveraging the architectural benefit and outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e., adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional generation.

Here we go beyond FVD by developing a metric which better measures plausible object interactions and motion. Our novel approach is based on auto-encoding point tracks and yields motion features that can be used to not only compare distributions of videos (as few as one generated and one ground truth, or as many as two datasets), but also for evaluating motion of single videos. We show that using point tracks instead of pixel reconstruction or action recognition features results in a metric which is markedly more sensitive to temporal distortions in synthetic data, and can predict human evaluations of temporal consistency and realism in generated videos obtained from open-source models better than a wide range of alternatives. We also show that by using a point track representation, we can spatiotemporally localize generative video inconsistencies, providing extra interpretability of generated video errors relative to prior work.

To this end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers which predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO foundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate prediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face datasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over 1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a FLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the uv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new benchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity facial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark is the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry. Ultimately, our method outperforms the most competitive baselines by over 15% in terms of geometric accuracy for posed facial expressions.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.00135v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rising popularity of immersive visual experiences has increased interest in stereoscopic 3D video generation. Despite significant advances in video synthesis, creating 3D videos remains challenging due to the relative scarcity of 3D video data. We propose a simple approach for transforming a text-to-video generator into a video-to-stereo generator. Given an input video, our framework automatically produces the video frames from a shifted viewpoint, enabling a compelling 3D effect. Prior and concurrent approaches for this task typically operate in multiple phases, first estimating video disparity or depth, then warping the video accordingly to produce a second view, and finally inpainting the disoccluded regions. This approach inherently fails when the scene involves specular surfaces or transparent objects. In such cases, single-layer disparity estimation is insufficient, resulting in artifacts and incorrect pixel shifts during warping. Our work bypasses these restrictions by directly synthesizing the new viewpoint, avoiding any intermediate steps. This is achieved by leveraging a pre-trained video model's priors on geometry, object materials, optics, and semantics, without relying on external geometry models or manually disentangling geometry from the synthesis process. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach in complex, real-world scenarios featuring diverse object materials and compositions. See videos on https://video-eye2eye.github.io",

Also, HATIE provides a fully-automated and omnidirectional evaluation pipeline. Particularly, we combine multiple scores measuring various aspects of editing so as to align with human perception.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.00564v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the field of X-ray security applications, even the smallest details can significantly impact outcomes. Objects that are heavily occluded or intentionally concealed pose a great challenge for detection, whether by human observation or through advanced technological applications. While certain Deep Learning (DL) architectures demonstrate strong performance in processing local information, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), others excel in handling distant information, e.g., transformers. In X-ray security imaging the literature has been dominated by the use of CNN-based methods, while the integration of the two aforementioned leading architectures has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, various hybrid CNN-transformer architectures are evaluated against a common CNN object detection baseline, namely YOLOv8. In particular, a CNN (HGNetV2) and a hybrid CNN-transformer (Next-ViT-S) backbone are combined with different CNN/transformer detection heads (YOLOv8 and RT-DETR). The resulting architectures are comparatively evaluated on three challenging public X-ray inspection datasets, namely EDS, HiXray, and PIDray. Interestingly, while the YOLOv8 detector with its default backbone (CSP-DarkNet53) is generally shown to be advantageous on the HiXray and PIDray datasets, when a domain distribution shift is incorporated in the X-ray images (as happens in the EDS datasets), hybrid CNN-transformer architectures exhibit increased robustness. Detailed comparative evaluation results, including object-level detection performance and object-size error analysis, demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of each architectural combination and suggest guidelines for future research.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.00507v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Active Learning has proved to be a relevant approach to perform sample selection for training models for Autonomous Driving. Particularly, previous works on active learning for 3D object detection have shown that selection of samples in uncontrolled scenarios is challenging. Furthermore, current approaches focus exclusively on the theoretical aspects of the sample selection problem but neglect the practical insights that can be obtained from the extensive literature and application of 3D detection models. In this paper, we introduce HeAL (Heuristical-enhanced Active Learning for 3D Object Detection) which integrates those heuristical features together with Localization and Classification to deliver the most contributing samples to the model's training. In contrast to previous works, our approach integrates heuristical features such as object distance and point-quantity to estimate the uncertainty, which enhance the usefulness of selected samples to train detection models. Our quantitative evaluation on KITTI shows that HeAL presents competitive mAP with respect to the State-of-the-Art, and achieves the same mAP as the full-supervised baseline with only 24% of the samples.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.00394v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing saliency detection methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to motion blur and occlusions. In contrast, spike cameras, with their high temporal resolution, significantly enhance visual saliency maps. However, the composite noise inherent to spike camera imaging introduces discontinuities in saliency detection. Low-quality samples further distort model predictions, leading to saliency bias. To address these challenges, we propose Spike-navigated Optimal TrAnsport Saliency Region Detection (SOTA), a framework that leverages the strengths of spike cameras while mitigating biases in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Our method introduces Spike-based Micro-debias (SM) to capture subtle frame-to-frame variations and preserve critical details, even under minimal scene or lighting changes. Additionally, Spike-based Global-debias (SG) refines predictions by reducing inconsistencies across diverse conditions. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SOTA outperforms existing methods by eliminating composite noise bias.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.00220v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) enables applications in holographic augmented reality (AR), 3D displays, systems neuroscience, and optical trapping. The fundamental challenge in CGH is solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval from intensity measurements. Physics-inspired neural networks (PINNs), especially Gerchberg-Saxton-based PINNs (GS-PINNs), have advanced phase retrieval capabilities. However, their performance strongly depends on forward models (FMs) and their hyperparameters (FMHs), limiting generalization, complicating benchmarking, and hindering hardware optimization. We present a systematic sensitivity analysis framework based on Saltelli's extension of Sobol's method to quantify FMH impacts on GS-PINN performance. Our analysis demonstrates that SLM pixel-resolution is the primary factor affecting neural network sensitivity, followed by pixel-pitch, propagation distance, and wavelength. Free space propagation forward models demonstrate superior neural network performance compared to Fourier holography, providing enhanced parameterization and generalization. We introduce a composite evaluation metric combining performance consistency, generalization capability, and hyperparameter perturbation resilience, establishing a unified benchmarking standard across CGH configurations. Our research connects physics-inspired deep learning theory with practical CGH implementations through concrete guidelines for forward model selection, neural network architecture, and performance evaluation. Our contributions advance the development of robust, interpretable, and generalizable neural networks for diverse holographic applications, supporting evidence-based decisions in CGH research and implementation.",

MCTS is often considered challenging to interpret due to the complexity of its search trees, but our framework is flexible enough to handle a wide range of free-form post-hoc queries and knowledge-based inquiries centered around MCTS and the Markov Decision Process (MDP) of the application domain. By transforming user queries into logic and variable statements, our framework ensures that the evidence obtained from the search tree remains factually consistent with the underlying environmental dynamics and any constraints in the actual stochastic control process.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.00534v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision sensors are becoming more important in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) for traffic monitoring, management, and optimization as the number of network cameras continues to rise. However, manual object tracking and matching across multiple non-overlapping cameras pose significant challenges in city-scale urban traffic scenarios. These challenges include handling diverse vehicle attributes, occlusions, illumination variations, shadows, and varying video resolutions. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and cost-effective deep learning-based framework for Multi-Object Multi-Camera Tracking (MO-MCT). The proposed framework utilizes Mask R-CNN for object detection and employs Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to select target objects from overlapping detections. Transfer learning is employed for re-identification, enabling the association and generation of vehicle tracklets across multiple cameras. Moreover, we leverage appropriate loss functions and distance measures to handle occlusion, illumination, and shadow challenges. The final solution identification module performs feature extraction using ResNet-152 coupled with Deep SORT based vehicle tracking. The proposed framework is evaluated on the 5th AI City Challenge dataset (Track 3), comprising 46 camera feeds. Among these 46 camera streams, 40 are used for model training and validation, while the remaining six are utilized for model testing. The proposed framework achieves competitive performance with an IDF1 score of 0.8289, and precision and recall scores of 0.9026 and 0.8527 respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in robust and accurate vehicle tracking.",

They offer strong landmarks to correct GNSS dropouts and anchor new sensor data in up-to-date maps. Despite that importance, intersection detectors either ignore the rich semantic information already computed onboard or depend on scarce, hand-labeled intersection datasets. To close that gap, this paper presents a LiDAR-based method for intersection detection that (i) fuses semantic road segmentation with vehicle localization to detect intersection candidates in a bird's eye view (BEV) representation and (ii) refines those candidates by analyzing branch topology with a least squares formulation. To evaluate our method, we introduce an automated benchmarking pipeline that pairs detections with OpenStreetMap (OSM) intersection nodes using precise GNSS/INS ground-truth poses. Tested on eight SemanticKITTI sequences, the approach achieves a mean localization error of 1.9 m, 89% precision, and 77% recall at a 5 m tolerance, outperforming the latest learning-based baseline. Moreover, the method is robust to segmentation errors higher than those of the benchmark model, demonstrating its applicability in the real world.",
