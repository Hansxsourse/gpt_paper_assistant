        "title": "Towards Autonomous UAV Visual Object Search in City Space: Benchmark and Agentic Methodology",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.08765v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aerial Visual Object Search (AVOS) tasks in urban environments require Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously search for and identify target objects using visual and textual cues without external guidance. Existing approaches struggle in complex urban environments due to redundant semantic processing, similar object distinction, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To bridge this gap and support the AVOS task, we introduce CityAVOS, the first benchmark dataset for autonomous search of common urban objects. This dataset comprises 2,420 tasks across six object categories with varying difficulty levels, enabling comprehensive evaluation of UAV agents' search capabilities. To solve the AVOS tasks, we also propose PRPSearcher (Perception-Reasoning-Planning Searcher), a novel agentic method powered by multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that mimics human three-tier cognition. Specifically, PRPSearcher constructs three specialized maps: an object-centric dynamic semantic map enhancing spatial perception, a 3D cognitive map based on semantic attraction values for target reasoning, and a 3D uncertainty map for balanced exploration-exploitation search. Also, our approach incorporates a denoising mechanism to mitigate interference from similar objects and utilizes an Inspiration Promote Thought (IPT) prompting mechanism for adaptive action planning. Experimental results on CityAVOS demonstrate that PRPSearcher surpasses existing baselines in both success rate and search efficiency (on average: +37.69% SR, +28.96% SPL, -30.69% MSS, and -46.40% NE). While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for better semantic reasoning and spatial exploration capabilities in AVOS tasks. This work establishes a foundation for future advances in embodied target search. Dataset and source code are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CityAVOS-3DF8.",

Their comprehension and reasoning capabilities enable promising applications in autonomous driving scenarios. However, existing research typically focuses on front-view perspectives and partial objects within scenes, struggling to achieve comprehensive scene understanding. Meanwhile, existing LVLMs suffer from the lack of mapping relationship between 2D and 3D and insufficient integration of 3D object localization and instruction understanding. To tackle these limitations, we first introduce NuInteract, a large-scale dataset with over 1.5M multi-view image language pairs spanning dense scene captions and diverse interactive tasks. Furthermore, we propose DriveMonkey, a simple yet effective framework that seamlessly integrates LVLMs with a spatial processor using a series of learnable queries. The spatial processor, designed as a plug-and-play component, can be initialized with pre-trained 3D detectors to improve 3D perception. Our experiments show that DriveMonkey outperforms general LVLMs, especially achieving a 9.86% notable improvement on the 3D visual grounding task.

However, their effectiveness in specialized domains-particularly those requiring resource-efficient and domain-specific adaptations-has remained limited. In this work, a lightweight multimodal language model termed MilChat is introduced, specifically adapted to analyze remote sensing imagery in secluded areas, including challenging missile launch sites. A new dataset, MilData, was compiled by verifying hundreds of aerial images through expert review, and subtle military installations were highlighted via detailed captions. Supervised fine-tuning on a 2B-parameter open-source MLLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning annotations was performed, enabling more accurate and interpretable explanations. Additionally, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was leveraged to enhance the model's ability to detect critical domain-specific cues-such as defensive layouts and key military structures-while minimizing false positives on civilian scenes. Through empirical evaluations, it has been shown that MilChat significantly outperforms both larger, general-purpose multimodal models and existing remote sensing-adapted approaches on open-ended captioning and classification metrics. Over 80% recall and 98% precision were achieved on the newly proposed MilData benchmark, underscoring the potency of targeted fine-tuning and reinforcement learning in specialized real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.08235v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) is a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision, particularly under conditions involving large motion, occlusion, and lighting variation. Recent advancements in event cameras have opened up new opportunities for addressing these challenges. While existing event-based VFI methods have succeeded in recovering large and complex motions by leveraging handcrafted intermediate representations such as optical flow, these designs often compromise high-fidelity image reconstruction under subtle motion scenarios due to their reliance on explicit motion modeling. Meanwhile, diffusion models provide a promising alternative for VFI by reconstructing frames through a denoising process, eliminating the need for explicit motion estimation or warping operations. In this work, we propose EventDiff, a unified and efficient event-based diffusion model framework for VFI. EventDiff features a novel Event-Frame Hybrid AutoEncoder (HAE) equipped with a lightweight Spatial-Temporal Cross Attention (STCA) module that effectively fuses dynamic event streams with static frames. Unlike previous event-based VFI methods, EventDiff performs interpolation directly in the latent space via a denoising diffusion process, making it more robust across diverse and challenging VFI scenarios. Through a two-stage training strategy that first pretrains the HAE and then jointly optimizes it with the diffusion model, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple synthetic and real-world event VFI datasets. The proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art event-based VFI methods by up to 1.98dB in PSNR on Vimeo90K-Triplet and shows superior performance in SNU-FILM tasks with multiple difficulty levels. Compared to the emerging diffusion-based VFI approach, our method achieves up to 5.72dB PSNR gain on Vimeo90K-Triplet and 4.24X faster inference.",

We propose a framework that compares local vision embeddings from runtime images to a database of nominal scenarios in which the autonomous system is deemed safe and performant. In this work, we consider two variants of the proposed framework: one using raw grid-based embeddings, and another leveraging instance segmentation for object-centric representations. To further improve robustness, we introduce a simple filtering mechanism to suppress false positives. Our evaluations on CARLA-simulated anomalies show that the instance-based method with filtering achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, while providing precise anomaly localization. These results highlight the potential utility of vision embeddings from foundation models for real-time anomaly detection in autonomous systems.",

This novel framework enhances RL generalization by learning and leveraging compositional causal components. Unlike previous approaches focusing on invariant representation learning or meta-learning, WM3C identifies and utilizes causal dynamics among composable elements, facilitating robust adaptation to new tasks. Our approach integrates language as a compositional modality to decompose the latent space into meaningful components and provides theoretical guarantees for their unique identification under mild assumptions. Our practical implementation uses a masked autoencoder with mutual information constraints and adaptive sparsity regularization to capture high-level semantic information and effectively disentangle transition dynamics.

This is important since the variety covers the visual richness captured by a drone's 3D flight, performing horizontal and vertical maneuvers. MESSI contains images annotated with location, orientation, and the camera's intrinsic parameters and can be used to train a deep neural network for semantic segmentation or other applications of interest (e.g., localization, navigation, and tracking). This paper describes the dataset and provides annotation details. It also explains how semantic segmentation was performed using several neural network models and shows several relevant statistics.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.08173v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Causal inference has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate long-tail classification by handling the biases introduced by class imbalance. However, along with the change of advanced backbone models from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Visual Transformers (ViT), existing causal models may not achieve an expected performance gain. This paper investigates the influence of existing causal models on CNNs and ViT variants, highlighting that ViT's global feature representation makes it hard for causal methods to model associations between fine-grained features and predictions, which leads to difficulties in classifying tail classes with similar visual appearance. To address these issues, this paper proposes TSCNet, a two-stage causal modeling method to discover fine-grained causal associations through multi-scale causal interventions. Specifically, in the hierarchical causal representation learning stage (HCRL), it decouples the background and objects, applying backdoor interventions at both the patch and feature level to prevent model from using class-irrelevant areas to infer labels which enhances fine-grained causal representation. In the counterfactual logits bias calibration stage (CLBC), it refines the optimization of model's decision boundary by adaptive constructing counterfactual balanced data distribution to remove the spurious associations in the logits caused by data distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on various long-tail benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TSCNet can eliminate multiple biases introduced by data imbalance, which outperforms existing methods.",

Further, non-AI experts do not necessarily have the ability to alter an agent or its policy. We introduce a technique for using World Models to generate explanations for Model-Based Deep RL agents. World Models predict how the world will change when actions are performed, allowing for the generation of counterfactual trajectories. However, identifying what a user wanted the agent to do is not enough to understand why the agent did something else. We augment Model-Based RL agents with a Reverse World Model, which predicts what the state of the world should have been for the agent to prefer a given counterfactual action. We show that explanations that show users what the world should have been like significantly increase their understanding of the agent policy. We hypothesize that our explanations can help users learn how to control the agents execution through by manipulating the environment.",

However, crafting effective textual prompts to guide these models remains challenging, often requiring extensive trial and error. Existing prompt inversion approaches, such as soft and hard prompt techniques, are not so effective due to the limited interpretability and incoherent prompt generation. To address these issues, we propose Visually Guided Decoding (VGD), a gradient-free approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) and CLIP-based guidance to generate coherent and semantically aligned prompts. In essence, VGD utilizes the robust text generation capabilities of LLMs to produce human-readable prompts. Further, by employing CLIP scores to ensure alignment with user-specified visual concepts, VGD enhances the interpretability, generalization, and flexibility of prompt generation without the need for additional training. Our experiments demonstrate that VGD outperforms existing prompt inversion techniques in generating understandable and contextually relevant prompts, facilitating more intuitive and controllable interactions with text-to-image models.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.08438v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Event cameras have emerged as promising sensors for 3D reconstruction due to their ability to capture per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously. Unlike conventional frame-based cameras, they produce sparse and temporally rich data streams, which enable more accurate 3D reconstruction and open up the possibility of performing reconstruction in extreme environments such as high-speed motion, low light, or high dynamic range scenes. In this survey, we provide the first comprehensive review focused exclusively on 3D reconstruction using event cameras. The survey categorises existing works into three major types based on input modality - stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems, and further classifies them by reconstruction approach, including geometry-based, deep learning-based, and recent neural rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. Methods with a similar research focus were organised chronologically into the most subdivided groups. We also summarise public datasets relevant to event-based 3D reconstruction. Finally, we highlight current research limitations in data availability, evaluation, representation, and dynamic scene handling, and outline promising future research directions. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive reference and a roadmap for future developments in event-driven 3D reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.08364v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite impressive progress in areas like mathematical reasoning, large language models still face significant challenges in consistently solving complex problems. Drawing inspiration from key human learning strategies, we propose two novel strategies to enhance the capability of large language models to solve these complex problems. First, Adaptive Difficulty Curriculum Learning (ADCL) is a novel curriculum learning strategy that tackles the Difficulty Shift phenomenon (i.e., a model's perception of problem difficulty dynamically changes during training) by periodically re-estimating difficulty within upcoming data batches to maintain alignment with the model's evolving capabilities. Second, Expert-Guided Self-Reformulation (EGSR) is a novel reinforcement learning strategy that bridges the gap between imitation learning and pure exploration by guiding models to reformulate expert solutions within their own conceptual framework, rather than relying on direct imitation, fostering deeper understanding and knowledge assimilation. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using Qwen2.5-7B as the base model, demonstrate that these human-inspired strategies synergistically and significantly enhance performance. Notably, their combined application improves performance over the standard Zero-RL baseline by 10% on the AIME24 benchmark and 16.6% on AIME25.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.08349v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) requires models to generalize from limited labeled samples under significant distribution shifts. While recent methods enhance adaptability through lightweight task-specific modules, they operate solely in the spatial domain and overlook frequency-specific variations that are often critical for robust transfer. We observe that spatially similar images across domains can differ substantially in their spectral representations, with low and high frequencies capturing complementary semantic information at coarse and fine levels. This indicates that uniform spatial adaptation may overlook these spectral distinctions, thus constraining generalization. To address this, we introduce Frequency Adaptation and Diversion (FAD), a frequency-aware framework that explicitly models and modulates spectral components. At its core is the Frequency Diversion Adapter, which transforms intermediate features into the frequency domain using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), partitions them into low, mid, and high-frequency bands via radial masks, and reconstructs each band using inverse DFT (IDFT). Each frequency band is then adapted using a dedicated convolutional branch with a kernel size tailored to its spectral scale, enabling targeted and disentangled adaptation across frequencies. Extensive experiments on the Meta-Dataset benchmark demonstrate that FAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both seen and unseen domains, validating the utility of frequency-domain representations and band-wise adaptation for improving generalization in CD-FSL.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.08234v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As AI-generated imagery becomes ubiquitous, invisible watermarks have emerged as a primary line of defense for copyright and provenance. The newest watermarking schemes embed semantic signals - content-aware patterns that are designed to survive common image manipulations - yet their true robustness against adaptive adversaries remains under-explored. We expose a previously unreported vulnerability and introduce SemanticRegen, a three-stage, label-free attack that erases state-of-the-art semantic and invisible watermarks while leaving an image's apparent meaning intact. Our pipeline (i) uses a vision-language model to obtain fine-grained captions, (ii) extracts foreground masks with zero-shot segmentation, and (iii) inpaints only the background via an LLM-guided diffusion model, thereby preserving salient objects and style cues. Evaluated on 1,000 prompts across four watermarking systems - TreeRing, StegaStamp, StableSig, and DWT/DCT - SemanticRegen is the only method to defeat the semantic TreeRing watermark (p = 0.10 > 0.05) and reduces bit-accuracy below 0.75 for the remaining schemes, all while maintaining high perceptual quality (masked SSIM = 0.94 +/- 0.01). We further introduce masked SSIM (mSSIM) to quantify fidelity within foreground regions, showing that our attack achieves up to 12 percent higher mSSIM than prior diffusion-based attackers. These results highlight an urgent gap between current watermark defenses and the capabilities of adaptive, semantics-aware adversaries, underscoring the need for watermarking algorithms that are resilient to content-preserving regenerative attacks.",

We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.",

To address this challenge, we propose an Attention-based Generative Latent Replay Continual Learning framework (AGLR-CL), in a multiple instance learning (MIL) setup for domain incremental WSI classification. Our method employs Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to synthesize WSI representations and patch count distributions, preserving knowledge of past domains without explicitly storing original data. A novel attention-based filtering step focuses on the most salient patch embeddings, ensuring high-quality synthetic samples. This privacy-aware strategy obviates the need for replay buffers and outperforms other buffer-free counterparts while matching the performance of buffer-based solutions. We validate AGLR-CL on clinically relevant biomarker detection and molecular status prediction across multiple public datasets with diverse centers, organs, and patient cohorts. Experimental results confirm its ability to retain prior knowledge and adapt to new domains, offering an effective, privacy-preserving avenue for domain incremental continual learning in WSI classification.",

Existing approaches rely on multi-branch architectures, orientation labels, or complex preprocessing steps, which limit scalability and generalization across real-world acquisition scenarios. In contrast, the proposed architecture introduces the GMSGI layer, a novel computational module that integrates grouped pixel-level involution, dynamic multi-scale kernel generation, and graph-based relational modelling into a single processing unit. Stacked GMSGI layers progressively refine both local minutiae-sensitive features and global topological representations through end-to-end optimization. The architecture eliminates explicit orientation supervision and adapts graph connectivity directly from learned kernel descriptors, thereby capturing meaningful structural relationships among fingerprint regions without fixed heuristics. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, namely PolyU, CFPose, and Benchmark 2D/3D, demonstrate that G-MSGINet consistently achieves minutiae F1-scores in the range of $0.83\\pm0.02$ and Rank-1 identification accuracies between 97.0% and 99.1%, while maintaining an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as 0.5%. These results correspond to improvements of up to 4.8% in F1-score and 1.4% in Rank-1 accuracy when compared to prior methods, using only 0.38 million parameters and 6.63 giga floating-point operations, which represents up to ten times fewer parameters than competitive baselines.

To this end, we propose a novel framework called FauForensics by introducing biologically invariant facial action units (FAUs), which is a quantitative descriptor of facial muscle activity linked to emotion physiology. It serves as forgery-resistant representations that reduce domain dependency while capturing subtle dynamics often disrupted in synthetic content.

Two key challenges in Knowledge Distillation (KD) are: 1) balancing learning from the teacher's guidance and the task objective, and 2) handling the disparity in knowledge representation between teacher and student models. To address these, we propose Multi-Task Optimization for Knowledge Distillation (MoKD). MoKD tackles two main gradient issues: a) Gradient Conflicts, where task-specific and distillation gradients are misaligned, and b) Gradient Dominance, where one objective's gradient dominates, causing imbalance. MoKD reformulates KD as a multi-objective optimization problem, enabling better balance between objectives. Additionally, it introduces a subspace learning framework to project feature representations into a high-dimensional space, improving knowledge transfer. Our MoKD is demonstrated to outperform existing methods through extensive experiments on image classification using the ImageNet-1K dataset and object detection using the COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency.

Existing methods typically rely on correlation-based strategies, where an image's classification feature is used as a query to retrieve the most related key prompts and select the corresponding value prompts for training. However, these approaches face an inherent limitation: fitting the entire feature space of all tasks with only a few trainable prompts is fundamentally challenging. We propose Predictive Prompting (PrePrompt), a novel CIL framework that circumvents correlation-based limitations by leveraging pre-trained models' natural classification ability to predict task-specific prompts. Specifically, PrePrompt decomposes CIL into a two-stage prediction framework: task-specific prompt prediction followed by label prediction. While theoretically appealing, this framework risks bias toward recent classes due to missing historical data for older classifier calibration. PrePrompt then mitigates this by incorporating feature translation, dynamically balancing stability and plasticity. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate PrePrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art prompt-based CIL methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.",

Here we introduce WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework designed to rejoin fragmented bamboo slips. Based on the physics of fracture and material deterioration, WisePanda automatically generates synthetic training data that captures the physical properties of bamboo fragmentations. This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the rejoining process. Compared to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda increases Top-50 matching accuracy from 36\\% to 52\\%. Archaeologists using WisePanda have experienced substantial efficiency improvements (approximately 20 times faster) when rejoining fragmented bamboo slips. This research demonstrates that incorporating physical principles into deep learning models can significantly enhance their performance, transforming how archaeologists restore and study fragmented artifacts.

To address these threats, we propose WaveGuard, a proactive watermarking framework that enhances robustness and imperceptibility via frequency-domain embedding and graph-based structural consistency. Specifically, we embed watermarks into high-frequency sub-bands using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) and employ a Structural Consistency Graph Neural Network (SC-GNN) to preserve visual quality. We also design an attention module to refine embedding precision. Experimental results on face swap and reenactment tasks demonstrate that WaveGuard outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both robustness and visual quality.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.08665v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Assessing human skill levels in complex activities is a challenging problem with applications in sports, rehabilitation, and training. In this work, we present SkillFormer, a parameter-efficient architecture for unified multi-view proficiency estimation from egocentric and exocentric videos. Building on the TimeSformer backbone, SkillFormer introduces a CrossViewFusion module that fuses view-specific features using multi-head cross-attention, learnable gating, and adaptive self-calibration. We leverage Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune only a small subset of parameters, significantly reducing training costs. In fact, when evaluated on the EgoExo4D dataset, SkillFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in multi-view settings while demonstrating remarkable computational efficiency, using 4.5x fewer parameters and requiring 3.75x fewer training epochs than prior baselines. It excels in multiple structured tasks, confirming the value of multi-view integration for fine-grained skill assessment.",

        "title": "An Identifiable Cost-Aware Causal Decision-Making Framework Using Counterfactual Reasoning",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.08343v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decision making under abnormal conditions is a critical process that involves evaluating the current state and determining the optimal action to restore the system to a normal state at an acceptable cost. However, in such scenarios, existing decision-making frameworks highly rely on reinforcement learning or root cause analysis, resulting in them frequently neglecting the cost of the actions or failing to incorporate causal mechanisms adequately. By relaxing the existing causal decision framework to solve the necessary cause, we propose a minimum-cost causal decision (MiCCD) framework via counterfactual reasoning to address the above challenges. Emphasis is placed on making counterfactual reasoning processes identifiable in the presence of a large amount of mixed anomaly data, as well as finding the optimal intervention state in a continuous decision space. Specifically, it formulates a surrogate model based on causal graphs, using abnormal pattern clustering labels as supervisory signals. This enables the approximation of the structural causal model among the variables and lays a foundation for identifiable counterfactual reasoning. With the causal structure approximated, we then established an optimization model based on counterfactual estimation. The Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithm is further employed to optimize intervention strategies while taking costs into account. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets reveal that MiCCD outperforms conventional methods across multiple metrics, including F1-score, cost efficiency, and ranking quality(nDCG@k values), thus validating its efficacy and broad applicability.",

Despite advances in tasks such as food classification and ingredient recognition, progress in nutrition estimation is limited due to the lack of datasets with nutritional annotations. To address this issue, we introduce FastFood, a dataset with 84,446 images across 908 fast food categories, featuring ingredient and nutritional annotations. In addition, we propose a new model-agnostic Visual-Ingredient Feature Fusion (VIF$^2$) method to enhance nutrition estimation by integrating visual and ingredient features. Ingredient robustness is improved through synonym replacement and resampling strategies during training. The ingredient-aware visual feature fusion module combines ingredient features and visual representation to achieve accurate nutritional prediction. During testing, ingredient predictions are refined using large multimodal models by data augmentation and majority voting. Our experiments on both FastFood and Nutrition5k datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method built in different backbones (e.g., Resnet, InceptionV3 and ViT), which demonstrates the importance of ingredient information in nutrition estimation. https://huiyanqi.github.io/fastfood-nutrition-estimation/.",

IrrMap consists of multi-resolution satellite imagery from LandSat and Sentinel, along with key auxiliary data such as crop type, land use, and vegetation indices. The dataset spans 1,687,899 farms and 14,117,330 acres across multiple western U.S. states from 2013 to 2023, providing a rich and diverse foundation for irrigation analysis and ensuring geospatial alignment and quality control. The dataset is ML-ready, with standardized 224x224 GeoTIFF patches, the multiple input modalities, carefully chosen train-test-split data, and accompanying dataloaders for seamless deep learning model training andbenchmarking in irrigation mapping. The dataset is also accompanied by a complete pipeline for dataset generation, enabling researchers to extend IrrMap to new regions for irrigation data collection or adapt it with minimal effort for other similar applications in agricultural and geospatial analysis. We also analyze the irrigation method distribution across crop groups, spatial irrigation patterns (using Shannon diversity indices), and irrigated area variations for both LandSat and Sentinel, providing insights into regional and resolution-based differences. To promote further exploration, we openly release IrrMap, along with the derived datasets, benchmark models, and pipeline code, through a GitHub repository: https://github.com/Nibir088/IrrMap and Data repository: https://huggingface.co/Nibir/IrrMap, providing comprehensive documentation and implementation details.",

However, when it comes to human body forgery, there has been a persistent lack of datasets and detection methods, due to the later inception and complexity of human body generation methods. To mitigate this issue, we introduce TikTok-DeepFake (TT-DF), a novel large-scale diffusion-based dataset containing 6,120 forged videos with 1,378,857 synthetic frames, specifically tailored for body forgery detection. TT-DF offers a wide variety of forgery methods, involving multiple advanced human image animation models utilized for manipulation, two generative configurations based on the disentanglement of identity and pose information, as well as different compressed versions. The aim is to simulate any potential unseen forged data in the wild as comprehensively as possible, and we also furnish a benchmark on TT-DF. Additionally, we propose an adapted body forgery detection model, Temporal Optical Flow Network (TOF-Net), which exploits the spatiotemporal inconsistencies and optical flow distribution differences between natural data and forged data. Our experiments demonstrate that TOF-Net achieves favorable performance on TT-DF, outperforming current state-of-the-art extendable facial forgery detection models.

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to identify key design factors affecting SIP-HI performance with 5 SFMs, focusing on encoder layer selection, prediction head architecture, and ensemble configurations. Our findings show that, contrary to traditional use-all-layers methods, selecting a single encoder layer yields better results. Additionally, temporal modeling is crucial for effective prediction heads. We also demonstrate that ensembling multiple SFMs improves performance, with stronger individual models providing greater benefit. Finally, we explore the relationship between key SFM attributes and their impact on SIP-HI performance.

However, existing models that rely solely on spectral features from satellite imagery are ineffective due to the complexity of agricultural landscapes and limited training data, making this a challenging problem. We present Knowledge-Informed Irrigation Mapping (KIIM), a novel Swin-Transformer based approach that uses (i) a specialized projection matrix to encode crop to irrigation probability, (ii) a spatial attention map to identify agricultural lands from non-agricultural lands, (iii) bi-directional cross-attention to focus complementary information from different modalities, and (iv) a weighted ensemble for combining predictions from images and crop information. Our experimentation on five states in the US shows up to 22.9\\% (IoU) improvement over baseline with a 71.4% (IoU) improvement for hard-to-classify drip irrigation. In addition, we propose a two-phase transfer learning approach to enhance cross-state irrigation mapping, achieving a 51% IoU boost in a state with limited labeled data. The ability to achieve baseline performance with only 40% of the training data highlights its efficiency, reducing the dependency on extensive manual labeling efforts and making large-scale, automated irrigation mapping more feasible and cost-effective.",

This is why we created the Calibration and Uncertainty for multiRater Volume Assessment in multiorgan Segmentation (CURVAS), which highlights the critical role of multiple annotators in establishing a more comprehensive ground truth, emphasizing that segmentation is inherently subjective and that leveraging inter-annotator variability is essential for robust model evaluation. Seven teams participated in the challenge, submitting a variety of DL models evaluated using metrics such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Expected Calibration Error (ECE), and Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). By incorporating consensus and dissensus ground truth, we assess how DL models handle uncertainty and whether their confidence estimates align with true segmentation performance. Our findings reinforce the importance of well-calibrated models, as better calibration is strongly correlated with the quality of the results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that segmentation models trained on diverse datasets and enriched with pre-trained knowledge exhibit greater robustness, particularly in cases deviating from standard anatomical structures. Notably, the best-performing models achieved high DSC and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. This work underscores the need for multi-annotator ground truth, thorough calibration assessments, and uncertainty-aware evaluations to develop trustworthy and clinically reliable DL-based medical image segmentation models.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2505.08117v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper audits damage labels derived from coincident satellite and drone aerial imagery for 15,814 buildings across Hurricanes Ian, Michael, and Harvey, finding 29.02% label disagreement and significantly different distributions between the two sources, which presents risks and potential harms during the deployment of machine learning damage assessment systems. Currently, there is no known study of label agreement between drone and satellite imagery for building damage assessment. The only prior work that could be used to infer if such imagery-derived labels agree is limited by differing damage label schemas, misaligned building locations, and low data quantities. This work overcomes these limitations by comparing damage labels using the same damage label schemas and building locations from three hurricanes, with the 15,814 buildings representing 19.05 times more buildings considered than the most relevant prior work. The analysis finds satellite-derived labels significantly under-report damage by at least 20.43% compared to drone-derived labels (p<1.2x10^-117), and satellite- and drone-derived labels represent significantly different distributions (p<5.1x10^-175). This indicates that computer vision and machine learning (CV/ML) models trained on at least one of these distributions will misrepresent actual conditions, as the differing satellite and drone-derived distributions cannot simultaneously represent the distribution of actual conditions in a scene. This potential misrepresentation poses ethical risks and potential societal harm if not managed. To reduce the risk of future societal harms, this paper offers four recommendations to improve reliability and transparency to decisio-makers when deploying CV/ML damage assessment systems in practice",
