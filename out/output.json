        "title": "Discrete Diffusion Models with MLLMs for Unified Medical Multimodal Generation",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.06131v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework, MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone, leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context, and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness. Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR 0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2, plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.",

        "title": "Teamwork: Collaborative Diffusion with Low-rank Coordination and Adaptation",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.05532v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\\ie, teammates). We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.",

        "title": "Efficient Conditional Generation on Scale-based Visual Autoregressive Models",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.05610v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore, recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.",

        "title": "Drive&Gen: Co-Evaluating End-to-End Driving and Video Generation Models",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2510.06209v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments. Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First, while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains, facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational contexts.",
