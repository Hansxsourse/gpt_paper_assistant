Our method addresses three critical requirements for effective training: precise 3D region segmentation, comprehensive textual descriptions, and sufficient dataset scale. By leveraging state-of-the-art open-vocabulary image segmentation models and region-aware Vision-Language Models, we develop an automatic pipeline that generates high-quality 3D mask-text pairs. Applying this pipeline to multiple 3D scene datasets, we create Mosaic3D-5.6M, a dataset of over 30K annotated scenes with 5.6M mask-text pairs, significantly larger than existing datasets. Building upon this data, we propose Mosaic3D, a foundation model combining a 3D encoder trained with contrastive learning and a lightweight mask decoder for open-vocabulary 3D semantic and instance segmentation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on open-vocabulary 3D semantic and instance segmentation tasks including ScanNet200, Matterport3D, and ScanNet++, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of our large-scale training data.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.02406v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cross-attention is commonly adopted in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for integrating visual information into the language backbone. However, in applications with large visual inputs, such as video understanding, processing a large number of visual tokens in cross-attention layers leads to high memory demands and often necessitates distributed computation across multiple GPUs. Existing distributed attention mechanisms face significant communication overheads, making cross-attention layers a critical bottleneck for efficient training and inference of MLLMs. To address this, we propose LV-XAttn, a distributed, exact cross-attention mechanism with minimal communication overhead. We observe that in applications involving large visual inputs the size of the query block is typically much smaller than that of the key-value blocks. Thus, in LV-XAttn we keep the large key-value blocks locally on each GPU and exchange smaller query blocks across GPUs. We also introduce an efficient activation recomputation technique enabling support for longer visual context. We theoretically analyze the communication benefits of LV-XAttn and show that it can achieve speedups for a wide range of models. Our evaluations with mPLUG-Owl3 and OpenFlamingo models find that LV-XAttn achieves up to 5.58$\\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to existing approaches.",

Recent advances in Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) for autonomous driving underscore the limitations of RGB-based approaches, which struggle under motion blur, poor lighting, and adverse weather. Event cameras, offering high dynamic range and low latency, address these challenges by providing asynchronous data that complements RGB inputs. We present DSEC-SSC, the first real-world benchmark specifically designed for event-aided SSC, which includes a novel 4D labeling pipeline for generating dense, visibility-aware labels that adapt dynamically to object motion. Our proposed RGB-Event fusion framework, EvSSC, introduces an Event-aided Lifting Module (ELM) that effectively bridges 2D RGB-Event features to 3D space, enhancing view transformation and the robustness of 3D volume construction across SSC models. Extensive experiments on DSEC-SSC and simulated SemanticKITTI-E demonstrate that EvSSC is adaptable to both transformer-based and LSS-based SSC architectures. Notably, evaluations on SemanticKITTI-C demonstrate that EvSSC achieves consistently improved prediction accuracy across five degradation modes and both In-domain and Out-of-domain settings, achieving up to a 52.5% relative improvement in mIoU when the image sensor partially fails. Additionally, we quantitatively and qualitatively validate the superiority of EvSSC under motion blur and extreme weather conditions, where autonomous driving is challenged.

To endow autonomous systems with such a holistic perception, learning how to correlate concepts, abstract knowledge across diverse tasks, and leverage tasks synergies when learning novel skills is essential. A significant step in this direction is EgoPack, a unified framework for understanding human activities across diverse tasks with minimal overhead. EgoPack promotes information sharing and collaboration among downstream tasks, essential for efficiently learning new skills. In this paper, we introduce Hier-EgoPack, which advances EgoPack by enabling reasoning also across diverse temporal granularities, which expands its applicability to a broader range of downstream tasks. To achieve this, we propose a novel hierarchical architecture for temporal reasoning equipped with a GNN layer specifically designed to tackle the challenges of multi-granularity reasoning effectively.

Category-level methods have received extensive research attention due to their potential for generalization to intra-class unknown objects. However, these methods require manual collection and labeling of large-scale real-world training data. To address this problem, we introduce a diffusion-based paradigm for domain-generalized category-level 9-DoF object pose estimation. Our motivation is to leverage the latent generalization ability of the diffusion model to address the domain generalization challenge in object pose estimation. This entails training the model exclusively on rendered synthetic data to achieve generalization to real-world scenes. We propose an effective diffusion model to redefine 9-DoF object pose estimation from a generative perspective. Our model does not require any 3D shape priors during training or inference. By employing the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model, we demonstrate that the reverse diffusion process can be executed in as few as 3 steps, achieving near real-time performance. Finally, we design a robotic grasping system comprising both hardware and software components. Through comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and the real-world robotic system, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art domain generalization performance.

Although prior Test-Time Training (TTT) techniques for VLMs have demonstrated robust performance, they predominantly rely on tuning text prompts, a process that demands substantial computational resources and is heavily dependent on entropy-based loss. In this paper, we propose LoRA-TTT, a novel TTT method that leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), applied exclusively to the image encoder of VLMs. By introducing LoRA and updating only its parameters during test time, our method offers a simple yet effective TTT approach, retaining the model's initial generalization capability while achieving substantial performance gains with minimal memory and runtime overhead. Additionally, we introduce a highly efficient reconstruction loss tailored for TTT. Our method can adapt to diverse domains by combining these two losses, without increasing memory consumption or runtime. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, covering 15 datasets, demonstrate that our method improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP-ViT-B/16 by an average of 5.79% on the OOD benchmark and 1.36% on the fine-grained benchmark, efficiently surpassing test-time prompt tuning, without relying on any external models or cache.",

Using reward models offers an alternative, however, current preference optimization methods fall short in exploiting the rich information, as they only consider pairwise preference distribution. Furthermore, they lack generalization to multi-preference scenarios and struggle to handle inconsistencies between rewards. To address this, we present Calibrated Preference Optimization (CaPO), a novel method to align T2I diffusion models by incorporating the general preference from multiple reward models without human annotated data. The core of our approach involves a reward calibration method to approximate the general preference by computing the expected win-rate against the samples generated by the pretrained models. Additionally, we propose a frontier-based pair selection method that effectively manages the multi-preference distribution by selecting pairs from Pareto frontiers. Finally, we use regression loss to fine-tune diffusion models to match the difference between calibrated rewards of a selected pair. Experimental results show that CaPO consistently outperforms prior methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in both single and multi-reward settings validated by evaluation on T2I benchmarks, including GenEval and T2I-Compbench.",

It is important for 3D shape understanding, structural analysis and geometric modeling. We introduce a novel fine-to-coarse unsupervised learning approach to abstract collections of 3D shapes. Our architectural design allows us to reduce the number of primitives from hundreds (fine reconstruction) to only a few (coarse abstraction) during training. This allows our network to optimize the reconstruction error and adhere to a user-specified number of primitives per shape while simultaneously learning a consistent structure across the whole collection of data. We achieve this through our abstraction loss formulation which increasingly penalizes redundant primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a reconstruction loss formulation to account not only for surface approximation but also volume preservation. Combining both contributions allows us to represent 3D shapes more precisely with fewer cuboid primitives than previous work. We evaluate our method on collections of man-made and humanoid shapes comparing with previous state-of-the-art learning methods on commonly used benchmarks. Our results confirm an improvement over previous cuboid-based shape abstraction techniques. Furthermore, we demonstrate our cuboid abstraction in downstream tasks like clustering, retrieval, and partial symmetry detection.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.01666v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Monocular depth estimation involves predicting depth from a single RGB image and plays a crucial role in applications such as autonomous driving, robotic navigation, 3D reconstruction, etc. Recent advancements in learning-based methods have significantly improved depth estimation performance. Generative models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have shown remarkable potential in recovering fine details and reconstructing missing regions through large-scale training on diverse datasets. However, models like CLIP, which rely on textual embeddings, face limitations in complex outdoor environments where rich context information is needed. These limitations reduce their effectiveness in such challenging scenarios. Here, we propose a novel image-based semantic embedding that extracts contextual information directly from visual features, significantly improving depth prediction in complex environments. Evaluated on the KITTI and Waymo datasets, our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models while addressing the shortcomings of CLIP embeddings in handling outdoor scenes. By leveraging visual semantics directly, our method demonstrates enhanced robustness and adaptability in depth estimation tasks, showcasing its potential for application to other visual perception tasks.",

Existing methods heavily depend on training data from a limited set of handcrafted articulated object categories (e.g., cabinets and drawers), which restricts their ability to model a wide range of articulated objects in an open-vocabulary context. To address these limitations, we propose Articulate Anymesh, an automated framework that is able to convert any rigid 3D mesh into its articulated counterpart in an open-vocabulary manner. Given a 3D mesh, our framework utilizes advanced Vision-Language Models and visual prompting techniques to extract semantic information, allowing for both the segmentation of object parts and the construction of functional joints. Our experiments show that Articulate Anymesh can generate large-scale, high-quality 3D articulated objects, including tools, toys, mechanical devices, and vehicles, significantly expanding the coverage of existing 3D articulated object datasets. Additionally, we show that these generated assets can facilitate the acquisition of new articulated object manipulation skills in simulation, which can then be transferred to a real robotic system.

To tackle this, we propose Geometric Neural Process Fields (G-NPF), a probabilistic framework for neural radiance fields that explicitly captures uncertainty. We formulate NeF generalization as a probabilistic problem, enabling direct inference of NeF function distributions from limited context observations. To incorporate structural inductive biases, we introduce a set of geometric bases that encode spatial structure and facilitate the inference of NeF function distributions. Building on these bases, we design a hierarchical latent variable model, allowing G-NPF to integrate structural information across multiple spatial levels and effectively parameterize INR functions. This hierarchical approach improves generalization to novel scenes and unseen signals.

In this paper, we propose Data- and Model-aware DPO (DAMO) to dynamically adjust the optimization process from two key aspects: (1) a data-aware strategy that incorporates data hardness, and (2) a model-aware strategy that integrates real-time model responses. By combining the two strategies, DAMO enables the model to effectively adapt to data with varying levels of hardness. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that DAMO not only significantly enhances the trustworthiness, but also improves the effectiveness over general tasks.

Traditional document layout analysis (DLA) methods, however, offer only a superficial parsing of documents, focusing on basic instance detection and often failing to capture the nuanced spatial and logical relations between instances. These limitations hinder DLA-based models from achieving a gradually deeper comprehension akin to human reading. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based Document Structure Analysis (gDSA) task. This task requires that model not only detects document elements but also generates spatial and logical relations in form of a graph structure, allowing to understand documents in a holistic and intuitive manner. For this new task, we construct a relation graph-based document structure analysis dataset (GraphDoc) with 80K document images and 4.13M relation annotations, enabling training models to complete multiple tasks like reading order, hierarchical structures analysis, and complex inter-element relation inference. Furthermore, a document relation graph generator (DRGG) is proposed to address the gDSA task, which achieves performance with 57.6% at mAP$_g$@0.5 for a strong benchmark baseline on this novel task and dataset. We hope this graphical representation of document structure can mark an innovative advancement in document structure analysis and understanding.

Recent advances in automated harvesting offer a promising solution by enabling efficient, cost-effective, and ergonomic fruit picking within tight harvesting windows. However, existing harvesting technologies often indiscriminately harvest all visible and accessible fruits, including those that are unripe or undersized. This study introduces a novel foundation model-based framework for efficient apple ripeness and size estimation. Specifically, we curated two public RGBD-based Fuji apple image datasets, integrating expanded annotations for ripeness (\"Ripe\" vs. \"Unripe\") based on fruit color and image capture dates. The resulting comprehensive dataset, Fuji-Ripeness-Size Dataset, includes 4,027 images and 16,257 annotated apples with ripeness and size labels. Using Grounding-DINO, a language-model-based object detector, we achieved robust apple detection and ripeness classification, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we developed and evaluated six size estimation algorithms, selecting the one with the lowest error and variation for optimal performance. The Fuji-Ripeness-Size Dataset and the apple detection and size estimation algorithms are made publicly available, which provides valuable benchmarks for future studies in automated and selective harvesting.",

However, its performance in the field of image manipulation detection remains largely unexplored and unconfirmed. There are two main challenges in applying SAM to image manipulation detection: a) reliance on manual prompts, and b) the difficulty of single-view information in supporting cross-dataset generalization. To address these challenges, we develops a cross-view prompt learning paradigm called IMDPrompter based on SAM. Benefiting from the design of automated prompts, IMDPrompter no longer relies on manual guidance, enabling automated detection and localization. Additionally, we propose components such as Cross-view Feature Perception, Optimal Prompt Selection, and Cross-View Prompt Consistency, which facilitate cross-view perceptual learning and guide SAM to generate accurate masks.

Recent works attribute this issue to an inherent bias of LVLMs where vision token attention map has a fixed correlation with spatial position, and propose to mitigate this issue by reordering visual tokens. However, we find that different LVLMs exhibit different correlations between attention and spatial position, which makes the existing solution difficult to generalize to other LVLMs. To address this issue, we first introduce a training-free solution, Uniform Attention Calibration (UAC), that estimates the bias from single meaningless input image and applies a calibration matrix to rectify attention imbalances. To further alleviate the bias, we relax the assumption of single meaningless input in UAC and introduce a fine-tuning solution, Dynamic Attention Calibration (DAC), that enforces the consistent outputs wherever the object locates in the image via a plug-and-plays module. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UAC and DAC significantly reduce object hallucination while improving general multimodal alignment.

AquaticCLIP presents a new unsupervised learning framework that aligns images and texts in aquatic environments, enabling tasks such as segmentation, classification, detection, and object counting. By leveraging our large-scale underwater image-text paired dataset without the need for ground-truth annotations, our model enriches existing vision-language models in the aquatic domain. For this purpose, we construct a 2 million underwater image-text paired dataset using heterogeneous resources, including YouTube, Netflix, NatGeo, etc. To fine-tune AquaticCLIP, we propose a prompt-guided vision encoder that progressively aggregates patch features via learnable prompts, while a vision-guided mechanism enhances the language encoder by incorporating visual context. The model is optimized through a contrastive pretraining loss to align visual and textual modalities. AquaticCLIP achieves notable performance improvements in zero-shot settings across multiple underwater computer vision tasks, outperforming existing methods in both robustness and interpretability.

The complicated denoising trajectory and high dimensionality of the latent space make it extremely challenging to interpret. Existing methods mainly explore the feature space of U-Net in Diffusion Models (DMs) instead of the latent space itself. In contrast, we directly investigate the latent space via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and discover three useful properties that can be used to control generation results without the requirements of data collection and maintain identity fidelity generated images. Based on these properties, we propose a novel image editing framework that is capable of learning arbitrary attributes from one pair of latent codes destined by text prompts in Stable Diffusion Models. To validate our approach, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness and flexibility in image editing.

However, they are still hard to meet requirements of applications due to unsatisfied generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose to align video foundation models with human preferences from the perspective of post-training in this paper. Consequently, we introduce an Iterative Preference Optimization strategy to enhance generated video quality by incorporating human feedback. Specifically, IPO exploits a critic model to justify video generations for pairwise ranking as in Direct Preference Optimization or point-wise scoring as in Kahneman-Tversky Optimization. Given this, IPO optimizes video foundation models with guidance of signals from preference feedback, which helps improve generated video quality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. In addition, IPO incorporates the critic model with the multi-modality large language model, which enables it to automatically assign preference labels without need of retraining or relabeling. In this way, IPO can efficiently perform multi-round preference optimization in an iterative manner, without the need of tediously manual labeling. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IPO can effectively improve the video generation quality of a pretrained model and help a model with only 2B parameters surpass the one with 5B parameters. Besides, IPO achieves new state-of-the-art performance on VBench benchmark. We will release our source codes, models as well as dataset to advance future research and applications.",

Spatial-temporal (ST) methods often separately model spatial interactions among pedestrians and temporal dependencies of individuals. They overlook the direct impacts of interactions among different pedestrians across various time steps (i.e., high-order cross-time interactions). This limits their ability to capture ST inter-dependencies and hinders prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose UniEdge with three major designs. Firstly, we introduce a unified ST graph data structure that simplifies high-order cross-time interactions into first-order relationships, enabling the learning of ST inter-dependencies in a single step. This avoids the information loss caused by multi-step aggregation. Secondly, traditional GNNs focus on aggregating pedestrian node features, neglecting the propagation of implicit interaction patterns encoded in edge features. We propose the Edge-to-Edge-Node-to-Node Graph Convolution (E2E-N2N-GCN), a novel dual-graph network that jointly models explicit N2N social interactions among pedestrians and implicit E2E influence propagation across these interaction patterns. Finally, to overcome the limited receptive fields and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies of auto-regressive architectures, we introduce a transformer encoder-based predictor that enables global modeling of temporal correlation. UniEdge outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple datasets, including ETH, UCY, and SDD.",

Finally, we propose a new inference technique that mitigates overexposure issues during inference by normalizing the text and image guidance vectors.

By leveraging their ability to process and interpret large-scale information, LLMs have shown potential to address domain-specific challenges, including those in autonomous driving systems. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages LLMs for risk-aware analysis of generated driving scenarios. We hypothesize that LLMs can effectively evaluate whether driving scenarios generated by autonomous driving testing simulators are safety-critical. To validate this hypothesis, we conducted an empirical evaluation to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in performing this task. This framework will also provide feedback to generate the new safety-critical scenario by using adversarial method to modify existing non-critical scenarios and test their effectiveness in validating motion planning algorithms.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.01685v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing methods for analyzing linguistic content from picture descriptions for assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment often overlook the participant's visual narrative path, which typically requires eye tracking to assess. Spatio-semantic graphs are a useful tool for analyzing this narrative path from transcripts alone, however they are limited by the need for manual tagging of content information units (CIUs). In this paper, we propose an automated approach for estimation of spatio-semantic graphs (via automated extraction of CIUs) from the Cookie Theft picture commonly used in cognitive-linguistic analyses. The method enables the automatic characterization of the visual semantic path during picture description. Experiments demonstrate that the automatic spatio-semantic graphs effectively differentiate between cognitively impaired and unimpaired speakers. Statistical analyses reveal that the features derived by the automated method produce comparable results to the manual method, with even greater group differences between clinical groups of interest. These results highlight the potential of the automated approach for extracting spatio-semantic features in developing clinical speech models for cognitive impairment assessment.",

However, the guidance of flow matching is more general than and thus substantially different from that of its predecessor, diffusion models. Therefore, the challenge in guidance for general flow matching remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first framework of general guidance for flow matching. From this framework, we derive a family of guidance techniques that can be applied to general flow matching. These include a new training-free asymptotically exact guidance, novel training losses for training-based guidance, and two classes of approximate guidance that cover classical gradient guidance methods as special cases. We theoretically investigate these different methods to give a practical guideline for choosing suitable methods in different scenarios. Experiments on synthetic datasets, image inverse problems, and offline reinforcement learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidance methods and verify the correctness of our flow matching guidance framework.

We address the long-standing limitation of remote sensing to penetrate deep into dense canopy layers. LiDAR and radar are currently considered the primary options for measuring 3D vegetation structures, while cameras can only extract the reflectance and depth of top layers. Using conventional, high-resolution aerial images, our approach allows sensing deep into self-occluding vegetation volumes, such as forests. It is similar in spirit to the imaging process of wide-field microscopy, but can handle much larger scales and strong occlusion. We scan focal stacks by synthetic-aperture imaging with drones and reduce out-of-focus signal contributions using pre-trained 3D convolutional neural networks. The resulting volumetric reflectance stacks contain low-frequency representations of the vegetation volume. Combining multiple reflectance stacks from various spectral channels provides insights into plant health, growth, and environmental conditions throughout the entire vegetation volume.",

One-step diffusion models generate high-quality images in a one sampling step, greatly reducing computational overhead and inference latency. However, most existing one-step diffusion methods are constrained by the performance of the teacher model, where poor teacher performance results in image artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose FluxSR, a novel one-step diffusion Real-ISR technique based on flow matching models. We use the state-of-the-art diffusion model FLUX.1-dev as both the teacher model and the base model. First, we introduce Flow Trajectory Distillation (FTD) to distill a multi-step flow matching model into a one-step Real-ISR. Second, to improve image realism and address high-frequency artifact issues in generated images, we propose TV-LPIPS as a perceptual loss and introduce Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) as a regularization term to reduce token similarity in transformer, thereby eliminating high-frequency artifacts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing one-step diffusion-based Real-ISR methods. The code and model will be released at https://github.com/JianzeLi-114/FluxSR.",

Therefore, these methods are not scalable with respect to the temporal dimension of the dynamic scene (i.e., the number of timesteps). In this work, we propose an efficient dynamic scene editing method that is more scalable in terms of temporal dimension. To achieve computational efficiency, we leverage a 4D Gaussian representation that models a 4D dynamic scene by combining static 3D Gaussians with a Hexplane-based deformation field, which handles dynamic information. We then perform editing solely on the static 3D Gaussians, which is the minimal but sufficient component required for visual editing. To resolve the misalignment between the edited 3D Gaussians and the deformation field potentially resulting from the editing process, we additionally conducted a refinement stage using a score distillation mechanism. Extensive editing results demonstrate that our method is efficient, reducing editing time by more than half compared to existing methods, while achieving high editing quality that better follows user instructions.",

However, the naive application of DMs presents several key limitations. (i) The diffusion prior has inferior semantic consistency (e.g., ID, structure and color.), increasing the difficulty of optimizing the BFR model; (ii) reliance on hundreds of denoising iterations, preventing the effective cooperation with perceptual losses, which is crucial for faithful restoration. Observing that the latent consistency model (LCM) learns consistency noise-to-data mappings on the ODE-trajectory and therefore shows more semantic consistency in the subject identity, structural information and color preservation, we propose InterLCM to leverage the LCM for its superior semantic consistency and efficiency to counter the above issues. Treating low-quality images as the intermediate state of LCM, InterLCM achieves a balance between fidelity and quality by starting from earlier LCM steps. LCM also allows the integration of perceptual loss during training, leading to improved restoration quality, particularly in real-world scenarios. To mitigate structural and semantic uncertainties, InterLCM incorporates a Visual Module to extract visual features and a Spatial Encoder to capture spatial details, enhancing the fidelity of restored images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterLCM outperforms existing approaches in both synthetic and real-world datasets while also achieving faster inference speed.",

Many existing works utilize Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to address this issue and have achieved impressive results. However, previous works assume the images of the training person are available and fixed while the appearances and poses of a subject could constantly change and increase in real-world scenarios. How to update the human avatar but also maintain the ability to render the old appearance of the person is a practical challenge. One trivial solution is to combine the existing virtual avatar models based on NeRF with continual learning methods. However, there are some critical issues in this approach: learning new appearances and poses can cause the model to forget past information, which in turn leads to a degradation in the rendering quality of past appearances, especially color bleeding issues, and incorrect human body poses. In this work, we propose a maintainable avatar (MaintaAvatar) based on neural radiance fields by continual learning, which resolves the issues by utilizing a Global-Local Joint Storage Module and a Pose Distillation Module. Overall, our model requires only limited data collection to quickly fine-tune the model while avoiding catastrophic forgetting, thus achieving a maintainable virtual avatar.

Despite the multifaceted nature of safety and trustworthiness in AI, current safety alignment methods often focus on a comprehensive notion of safety. By carefully assessing models from the existing safety-alignment methods, we found that, while they generally improved overall safety performance, they failed to ensure safety in specific categories. Our study first identified the difficulty of eliminating such vulnerabilities without sacrificing the model's helpfulness. We observed that, while smaller KL penalty parameters, increased training iterations, and dataset cleansing can enhance safety, they do not necessarily improve the trade-off between safety and helpfulness. We discovered that safety alignment could even induce undesired effects and result in a model that prefers generating negative tokens leading to rejective responses, regardless of the input context. To address this, we introduced a learning-free method, Token-level Safety-Debiased Inference (TSDI), to estimate and correct this bias during the generation process using randomly constructed prompts. Our experiments demonstrated that our method could enhance the model's helpfulness while maintaining safety, thus improving the trade-off Pareto-front.",

However, current approaches in this field tend to offer isolated solutions tailored to specific tasks, which can be inefficient and impractical for real-world applications. While some efforts have aimed to unify motion-related tasks, these methods simply use different modalities as conditions to guide motion generation. Consequently, they lack editing capabilities, fine-grained control, and fail to facilitate knowledge sharing across tasks. To address these limitations and provide a versatile, unified framework capable of handling both human motion generation and editing, we introduce a novel paradigm: Motion-Condition-Motion, which enables the unified formulation of diverse tasks with three concepts: source motion, condition, and target motion.Based on this paradigm, we propose a unified framework, MotionLab, which incorporates rectified flows to learn the mapping from source motion to target motion, guided by the specified conditions.In MotionLab, we introduce the 1) MotionFlow Transformer to enhance conditional generation and editing without task-specific modules; 2) Aligned Rotational Position Encoding} to guarantee the time synchronization between source motion and target motion; 3) Task Specified Instruction Modulation; and 4) Motion Curriculum Learning for effective multi-task learning and knowledge sharing across tasks. Notably, our MotionLab demonstrates promising generalization capabilities and inference efficiency across multiple benchmarks for human motion.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.02465v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current face editing methods mainly rely on GAN-based techniques, but recent focus has shifted to diffusion-based models due to their success in image reconstruction. However, diffusion models still face challenges in manipulating fine-grained attributes and preserving consistency of attributes that should remain unchanged. To address these issues and facilitate more convenient editing of face images, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of Stable-Diffusion models and crude 3D face models to control the lighting, facial expression and head pose of a portrait photo. We observe that this task essentially involve combinations of target background, identity and different face attributes. We aim to sufficiently disentangle the control of these factors to enable high-quality of face editing. Specifically, our method, coined as RigFace, contains: 1) A Spatial Arrtibute Encoder that provides presise and decoupled conditions of background, pose, expression and lighting; 2) An Identity Encoder that transfers identity features to the denoising UNet of a pre-trained Stable-Diffusion model; 3) An Attribute Rigger that injects those conditions into the denoising UNet. Our model achieves comparable or even superior performance in both identity preservation and photorealism compared to existing face editing models.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.01694v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A key paradigm to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is to allocate more inference-time compute to search against a verifier or reward model. This process can then be utilized to refine the pretrained model or distill its reasoning patterns into more efficient models. In this paper, we study inference-time compute by viewing chain-of-thought (CoT) generation as a metastable Markov process: easy reasoning steps (e.g., algebraic manipulations) form densely connected clusters, while hard reasoning steps (e.g., applying a relevant theorem) create sparse, low-probability edges between clusters, leading to phase transitions at longer timescales. Under this framework, we prove that implementing a search protocol that rewards sparse edges improves CoT by decreasing the expected number of steps to reach different clusters. In contrast, we establish a limit on reasoning capability when the model is restricted to local information of the pretrained graph. We also show that the information gained by search can be utilized to obtain a better reasoning model: (1) the pretrained model can be directly finetuned to favor sparse edges via policy gradient methods, and moreover (2) a compressed metastable representation of the reasoning dynamics can be distilled into a smaller, more efficient model.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.02537v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Collaborative Object Detection (COD) and collaborative perception can integrate data or features from various entities, and improve object detection accuracy compared with individual perception. However, adversarial attacks pose a potential threat to the deep learning COD models, and introduce high output uncertainty. With unknown attack models, it becomes even more challenging to improve COD resiliency and quantify the output uncertainty for highly dynamic perception scenes such as autonomous vehicles. In this study, we propose the Trusted Uncertainty Quantification in Collaborative Perception framework (TUQCP). TUQCP leverages both adversarial training and uncertainty quantification techniques to enhance the adversarial robustness of existing COD models. More specifically, TUQCP first adds perturbations to the shared information of randomly selected agents during object detection collaboration by adversarial training. TUQCP then alleviates the impacts of adversarial attacks by providing output uncertainty estimation through learning-based module and uncertainty calibration through conformal prediction. Our framework works for early and intermediate collaboration COD models and single-agent object detection models. We evaluate TUQCP on V2X-Sim, a comprehensive collaborative perception dataset for autonomous driving, and demonstrate a 80.41% improvement in object detection accuracy compared to the baselines under the same adversarial attacks. TUQCP demonstrates the importance of uncertainty quantification to COD under adversarial attacks.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.01896v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we present INTACT, a novel two-phase framework designed to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) against noisy LiDAR data in safety-critical perception tasks. INTACT combines meta-learning with adversarial curriculum training (ACT) to systematically address challenges posed by data corruption and sparsity in 3D point clouds. The meta-learning phase equips a teacher network with task-agnostic priors, enabling it to generate robust saliency maps that identify critical data regions. The ACT phase leverages these saliency maps to progressively expose a student network to increasingly complex noise patterns, ensuring targeted perturbation and improved noise resilience. INTACT's effectiveness is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on object detection, tracking, and classification benchmarks using diverse datasets, including KITTI, Argoverse, and ModelNet40. Results indicate that INTACT improves model robustness by up to 20% across all tasks, outperforming standard adversarial and curriculum training methods. This framework not only addresses the limitations of conventional training strategies but also offers a scalable and efficient solution for real-world deployment in resource-constrained safety-critical systems. INTACT's principled integration of meta-learning and adversarial training establishes a new paradigm for noise-tolerant 3D perception in safety-critical applications. INTACT improved KITTI Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) by 9.6% (64.1% -> 75.1%) and by 12.4% under Gaussian noise (52.5% -> 73.7%). Similarly, KITTI mean Average Precision (mAP) rose from 59.8% to 69.8% (50% point drop) and 49.3% to 70.9% (Gaussian noise), highlighting the framework's ability to enhance deep learning model resilience in safety-critical object tracking scenarios.",

However, errors in 2D results often propagate, leading to oversegmentations in the final 3D results. To tackle this issue, we introduce an interpretable geometric framework that addresses the oversegmentations by correcting the 2D segmentation results based on geometric information from adjacent layers. Leveraging both geometric (layer-to-layer, 2D) and topological (3D shape) features, we use binary classification to determine whether neighboring cells should be stitched. We develop a pre-trained classifier on public plant cell datasets and validate its performance on animal cell datasets, confirming its effectiveness in correcting oversegmentations under the transfer learning setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our framework can be extended to correcting oversegmentation on non-2D-based methods.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.02097v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Lateral Spine Image (LSI) analysis is important for medical diagnosis, treatment planning, and detailed spinal health assessments. Although modalities like Computed Tomography and Digital X-ray Imaging are commonly used, Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is often preferred due to lower radiation exposure, seamless capture, and cost-effectiveness. Accurate Vertebral Landmark Localization (VLL) on LSIs is important to detect spinal conditions like kyphosis and lordosis, as well as assessing Abdominal Aortic Calcification (AAC) using Inter-Vertebral Guides (IVGs). Nonetheless, few automated VLL methodologies have concentrated on DXA LSIs. We present VerteNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model featuring a novel dual-resolution attention mechanism in self and cross-attention domains, referred to as Dual Resolution Self-Attention (DRSA) and Dual Resolution Cross-Attention (DRCA). These mechanisms capture the diverse frequencies in DXA images by operating at two different feature map resolutions. Additionally, we design a Multi-Context Feature Fusion Block (MCFB) that efficiently integrates the features using DRSA and DRCA. We train VerteNet on 620 DXA LSIs from various machines and achieve superior results compared to existing methods. We also design an algorithm that utilizes VerteNet's predictions in estimating the Region of Interest (ROI) to detect potential abdominal aorta cropping, where inadequate soft tissue hinders calcification assessment. Additionally, we present a small proof-of-concept study to show that IVGs generated from VLL information can improve inter-reader correlation in AAC scoring, addressing two key areas of disagreement in expert AAC-24 scoring: IVG placement and quality control for full abdominal aorta assessment.

We carefully curate multiple facial datasets that capture diverse variations in identity, lighting, background, and head poses.

Furthermore, we introduce a single memory tensor to capture information accrued from the past frames and improve motion estimation across frames. This design enables an efficient balance between computational cost and reconstruction quality. With just 2.3 million parameters, our model achieves state-of-the-art SSIM of 0.9175 on the REDS4 dataset, surpassing existing lightweight and many heavy models in both accuracy and resource efficiency.

In this work, we propose META, a simple and fast ViT adapter that can improve the model's memory efficiency and decrease memory time consumption by reducing the inefficient memory access operations. Our method features a memory-efficient adapter block that enables the common sharing of layer normalization between the self-attention and feed-forward network layers, thereby reducing the model's reliance on normalization operations. Within the proposed block, the cross-shaped self-attention is employed to reduce the model's frequent reshaping operations. Moreover, we augment the adapter block with a lightweight convolutional branch that can enhance local inductive biases, particularly beneficial for the dense prediction tasks, e.g., object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The adapter block is finally formulated in a cascaded manner to compute diverse head features, thereby enriching the variety of feature representations. Empirically, extensive evaluations on multiple representative datasets validate that META substantially enhances the predicted quality, while achieving a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

Existing learning-based BDQA methods have achieved remarkable success, while the small scale of DQA datasets limits their performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to adapt Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP), pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs, to the BDQA task. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the human visual system understands images based on hierarchical features, we take global and local information of the dehazed image as the input of CLIP. To accurately map the input hierarchical information of dehazed images into the quality score, we tune both the vision branch and language branch of CLIP with prompt learning. Experimental results on two authentic DQA datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach, named CLIP-DQA, achieves more accurate quality predictions over existing BDQA methods.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.02234v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MvC) utilizes information from multiple views to uncover the underlying structures of data. Despite significant advancements in MvC, mitigating the impact of missing samples in specific views on the integration of knowledge from different views remains a critical challenge. This paper proposes a novel Mask-informed Deep Contrastive Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (Mask-IMvC) method, which elegantly identifies a view-common representation for clustering. Specifically, we introduce a mask-informed fusion network that aggregates incomplete multi-view information while considering the observation status of samples across various views as a mask, thereby reducing the adverse effects of missing values. Additionally, we design a prior knowledge-assisted contrastive learning loss that boosts the representation capability of the aggregated view-common representation by injecting neighborhood information of samples from different views. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Mask-IMvC method over state-of-the-art approaches across multiple MvC datasets, both in complete and incomplete scenarios.",

        "title": "Sparse VideoGen: Accelerating Video Diffusion Transformers with Spatial-Temporal Sparsity",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.01776v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) dominate video generation but their high computational cost severely limits real-world applicability, usually requiring tens of minutes to generate a few seconds of video even on high-performance GPUs. This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality.",

        "title": "MATCNN: Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Method Based on Multi-scale CNN with Attention Transformer",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.01959v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While attention-based approaches have shown considerable progress in enhancing image fusion and addressing the challenges posed by long-range feature dependencies, their efficacy in capturing local features is compromised by the lack of diverse receptive field extraction techniques. To overcome the shortcomings of existing fusion methods in extracting multi-scale local features and preserving global features, this paper proposes a novel cross-modal image fusion approach based on a multi-scale convolutional neural network with attention Transformer (MATCNN). MATCNN utilizes the multi-scale fusion module (MSFM) to extract local features at different scales and employs the global feature extraction module (GFEM) to extract global features. Combining the two reduces the loss of detail features and improves the ability of global feature representation. Simultaneously, an information mask is used to label pertinent details within the images, aiming to enhance the proportion of preserving significant information in infrared images and background textures in visible images in fused images. Subsequently, a novel optimization algorithm is developed, leveraging the mask to guide feature extraction through the integration of content, structural similarity index measurement, and global feature loss. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations are conducted across various datasets, revealing that MATCNN effectively highlights infrared salient targets, preserves additional details in visible images, and achieves better fusion results for cross-modal images. The code of MATCNN will be available at https://github.com/zhang3849/MATCNN.git.",

        "title": "Hierarchical Consensus Network for Multiview Feature Learning",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.01961v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multiview feature learning aims to learn discriminative features by integrating the distinct information in each view. However, most existing methods still face significant challenges in learning view-consistency features, which are crucial for effective multiview learning. Motivated by the theories of CCA and contrastive learning in multiview feature learning, we propose the hierarchical consensus network (HCN) in this paper. The HCN derives three consensus indices for capturing the hierarchical consensus across views, which are classifying consensus, coding consensus, and global consensus, respectively. Specifically, classifying consensus reinforces class-level correspondence between views from a CCA perspective, while coding consensus closely resembles contrastive learning and reflects contrastive comparison of individual instances. Global consensus aims to extract consensus information from two perspectives simultaneously. By enforcing the hierarchical consensus, the information within each view is better integrated to obtain more comprehensive and discriminative features. The extensive experimental results obtained on four multiview datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.",

        "title": "Mind the Gap: Evaluating Patch Embeddings from General-Purpose and Histopathology Foundation Models for Cell Segmentation and Classification",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.02471v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have transformed computer vision, driving significant performance improvements across diverse domains, including digital histopathology. However, the advantages of domain-specific histopathology foundation models over general-purpose models for specialized tasks such as cell analysis remain underexplored. This study investigates the representation learning gap between these two categories by analyzing multi-level patch embeddings applied to cell instance segmentation and classification. We implement an encoder-decoder architecture with a consistent decoder and various encoders. These include convolutional, vision transformer (ViT), and hybrid encoders pre-trained on ImageNet-22K or LVD-142M, representing general-purpose foundation models. These are compared against ViT encoders from the recently released UNI, Virchow2, and Prov-GigaPath foundation models, trained on patches extracted from hundreds of thousands of histopathology whole-slide images. The decoder integrates patch embeddings from different encoder depths via skip connections to generate semantic and distance maps. These maps are then post-processed to create instance segmentation masks where each label corresponds to an individual cell and to perform cell-type classification. All encoders remain frozen during training to assess their pre-trained feature extraction capabilities. Using the PanNuke and CoNIC histopathology datasets, and the newly introduced Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies, we evaluate instance-level detection, segmentation accuracy, and cell-type classification. This study provides insights into the comparative strengths and limitations of general-purpose vs. histopathology foundation models, offering guidance for model selection in cell-focused histopathology and brain cytoarchitecture analysis workflows.",
