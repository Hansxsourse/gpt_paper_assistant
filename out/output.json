The research community has responded by using distillation from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks focusing on the ability to reason about \"what\", \"where\", \"when\", and \"how\" of a video.

Traditionally, vision encoders have relied on a variety of pretraining objectives, each tailored to specific downstream tasks such as classification, captioning, or localization. Surprisingly, after scaling our carefully tuned image pretraining recipe and refining with our robust video data engine, we find that contrastive vision-language training alone can produce strong, general embeddings for all of these downstream tasks. There is only one caveat: these embeddings are hidden within the intermediate layers of the network. To draw them out, we introduce two alignment methods, language alignment for multimodal language modeling, and spatial alignment for dense prediction. Together with the core contrastive checkpoint, our PE family of models achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of tasks, including zero-shot image and video classification and retrieval; document, image, and video Q&A and spatial tasks such as detection, depth estimation, and tracking.

However, a major challenge in developing generalized GUI agents is the lack of sufficient trajectory data across various operating systems and applications, mainly due to the high cost of manual annotations. In this paper, we propose the TongUI framework that builds generalized GUI agents by learning from rich multimodal web tutorials. Concretely, we crawl and process online GUI tutorials (such as videos and articles) into GUI agent trajectory data, through which we produce the GUI-Net dataset containing 143K trajectory data across five operating systems and more than 200 applications. We develop the TongUI agent by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B models on GUI-Net, which show remarkable performance improvements on commonly used grounding and navigation benchmarks, outperforming baseline agents about 10\\% on multiple benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the GUI-Net dataset and underscoring the significance of our TongUI framework.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2504.12395v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current learning-based subject customization approaches, predominantly relying on U-Net architectures, suffer from limited generalization ability and compromised image quality. Meanwhile, optimization-based methods require subject-specific fine-tuning, which inevitably degrades textual controllability. To address these challenges, we propose InstantCharacter, a scalable framework for character customization built upon a foundation diffusion transformer. InstantCharacter demonstrates three fundamental advantages: first, it achieves open-domain personalization across diverse character appearances, poses, and styles while maintaining high-fidelity results. Second, the framework introduces a scalable adapter with stacked transformer encoders, which effectively processes open-domain character features and seamlessly interacts with the latent space of modern diffusion transformers. Third, to effectively train the framework, we construct a large-scale character dataset containing 10-million-level samples. The dataset is systematically organized into paired (multi-view character) and unpaired (text-image combinations) subsets. This dual-data structure enables simultaneous optimization of identity consistency and textual editability through distinct learning pathways. Qualitative experiments demonstrate the advanced capabilities of InstantCharacter in generating high-fidelity, text-controllable, and character-consistent images, setting a new benchmark for character-driven image generation.

Some researchers have begun exploring pre-training directly on event data. Nevertheless, these efforts often fail to establish strong connections with RGB frames, limiting their applicability in multi-modal fusion scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel CM3AE pre-training framework for the RGB-Event perception. This framework accepts multi-modalities/views of data as input, including RGB images, event images, and event voxels, providing robust support for both event-based and RGB-event fusion based downstream tasks. Specifically, we design a multi-modal fusion reconstruction module that reconstructs the original image from fused multi-modal features, explicitly enhancing the model's ability to aggregate cross-modal complementary information. Additionally, we employ a multi-modal contrastive learning strategy to align cross-modal feature representations in a shared latent space, which effectively enhances the model's capability for multi-modal understanding and capturing global dependencies. We construct a large-scale dataset containing 2,535,759 RGB-Event data pairs for the pre-training. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks fully demonstrated the effectiveness of CM3AE.

The FramePack compresses input frames to make the transformer context length a fixed number regardless of the video length. As a result, we are able to process a large number of frames using video diffusion with computation bottleneck similar to image diffusion. This also makes the training video batch sizes significantly higher (batch sizes become comparable to image diffusion training). We also propose an anti-drifting sampling method that generates frames in inverted temporal order with early-established endpoints to avoid exposure bias (error accumulation over iterations). Finally, we show that existing video diffusion models can be finetuned with FramePack, and their visual quality may be improved because the next-frame prediction supports more balanced diffusion schedulers with less extreme flow shift timesteps.",

The use of computer vision approaches for the automatic recognition of perioperative events enables identification of bottlenecks for OR optimization. However, privacy concerns limit the use of computer vision for automated event detection from OR videos, which makes privacy-preserving approaches needed for OR workflow analysis. Methods: We propose a two-stage pipeline for privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. In the first stage, we leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic segmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from conventional RGB videos. In the second stage, we employ the SafeOR model, a fused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for OR event detection. We evaluate this method on an internal dataset of 38 simulated surgical trials with five event classes. Results: Our results indicate that this DT-based approach to the OR event detection model achieves performance on par and sometimes even better than raw RGB video-based models on detecting OR events. Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow analysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions and they can potentially enhance model generalizability by mitigating domain-specific appearance differences.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2504.13153v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bridging natural language and 3D geometry is a crucial step toward flexible, language-driven scene understanding. While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast and high-quality scene reconstruction, research has also explored incorporating open-vocabulary understanding into 3DGS. However, most existing methods require iterative optimization over per-view 2D semantic feature maps, which not only results in inefficiencies but also leads to inconsistent 3D semantics across views. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free framework that constructs a superpoint graph directly from Gaussian primitives. The superpoint graph partitions the scene into spatially compact and semantically coherent regions, forming view-consistent 3D entities and providing a structured foundation for open-vocabulary understanding. Based on the graph structure, we design an efficient reprojection strategy that lifts 2D semantic features onto the superpoints, avoiding costly multi-view iterative training. The resulting representation ensures strong 3D semantic coherence and naturally supports hierarchical understanding, enabling both coarse- and fine-grained open-vocabulary perception within a unified semantic field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation performance, with semantic field reconstruction completed over $30\\times$ faster.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2504.12795v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in the visual-language area have developed natural multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for spatial reasoning through visual prompting. However, due to remote sensing (RS) imagery containing abundant geospatial information that differs from natural images, it is challenging to effectively adapt natural spatial models to the RS domain. Moreover, current RS MLLMs are limited in overly narrow interpretation levels and interaction manner, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address those challenges, a spatial MLLM named EarthGPT-X is proposed, enabling a comprehensive understanding of multi-source RS imagery, such as optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and infrared. EarthGPT-X offers zoom-in and zoom-out insight, and possesses flexible multi-grained interactive abilities. Moreover, EarthGPT-X unifies two types of critical spatial tasks (i.e., referring and grounding) into a visual prompting framework. To achieve these versatile capabilities, several key strategies are developed. The first is the multi-modal content integration method, which enhances the interplay between images, visual prompts, and text instructions. Subsequently, a cross-domain one-stage fusion training strategy is proposed, utilizing the large language model (LLM) as a unified interface for multi-source multi-task learning. Furthermore, by incorporating a pixel perception module, the referring and grounding tasks are seamlessly unified within a single framework. In addition, the experiments conducted demonstrate the superiority of the proposed EarthGPT-X in multi-grained tasks and its impressive flexibility in multi-modal interaction, revealing significant advancements of MLLM in the RS field.",

Recent neural rendering advances have enabled holistic human-scene reconstruction but require pre-calibrated camera and human poses, and days of training time. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs camera tracking, human pose estimation and human-scene reconstruction in an online fashion. 3D Gaussian Splatting is utilized to learn Gaussian primitives for humans and scenes efficiently, and reconstruction-based camera tracking and human pose estimation modules are designed to enable holistic understanding and effective disentanglement of pose and appearance. Specifically, we design a human deformation module to reconstruct the details and enhance generalizability to out-of-distribution poses faithfully. Aiming to learn the spatial correlation between human and scene accurately, we introduce occlusion-aware human silhouette rendering and monocular geometric priors, which further improve reconstruction quality. Experiments on the EMDB and NeuMan datasets demonstrate superior or on-par performance with existing methods in camera tracking, human pose estimation, novel view synthesis and runtime.

Further, the agent will sometimes lack relevant knowledge and/or sufficient time to assess the situation, generate and evaluate options, and pursue a robustly considered course of action. How can an agent respond reasonably to situations that are outside of its original design scope? How can it recognize such situations sufficiently quickly and reliably to determine reasonable, adaptive courses of action? We identify key characteristics needed for solutions, evaluate the state-of-the-art by these requirements, and outline a proposed, novel approach that combines domain-general meta-knowledge (in the form of appraisals inspired by human cognition) and metareasoning. It has the potential to provide fast, adaptive responses to unfamiliar situations, more fully meeting the performance characteristics required for open-world, general agents.",

With limited high-quality training data and heavy computing requirements, the combination of hallucinating unseen geometry together with unseen movement poses great challenges to generative models. In this work, we propose TwoSquared as a method to obtain a 4D physically plausible sequence starting from only two 2D RGB images corresponding to the beginning and end of the action. Instead of directly solving the 4D generation problem, TwoSquared decomposes the problem into two steps: 1) an image-to-3D module generation based on the existing generative model trained on high-quality 3D assets, and 2) a physically inspired deformation module to predict intermediate movements. To this end, our method does not require templates or object-class-specific prior knowledge and can take in-the-wild images as input. In our experiments, we demonstrate that TwoSquared is capable of producing texture-consistent and geometry-consistent 4D sequences only given 2D images.",

Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like GPT-4V and DALLE-3 have sparked debate about whether their outputs reflect combinational creativity--defined by M. A. Boden (1998) as synthesizing novel ideas through combining existing concepts--or sophisticated pattern matching of training data. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we investigate the combinational creativity of VLMs from the lens of concept blending. We propose the Identification-Explanation-Implication (IEI) framework, which decomposes creative processes into three levels: identifying input spaces, extracting shared attributes, and deriving novel semantic implications. To validate this framework, we curate CreativeMashup, a high-quality dataset of 666 artist-generated visual mashups annotated according to the IEI framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that in comprehension tasks, best VLMs have surpassed average human performance while falling short of expert-level understanding; in generation tasks, incorporating our IEI framework into the generation pipeline significantly enhances the creative quality of VLMs outputs. Our findings establish both a theoretical foundation for evaluating artificial creativity and practical guidelines for improving creative generation in VLMs.",

While advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms excel at analyzing EO imagery data, they often overlook crucial geospatial metadata information that could enhance scalability and accuracy across regional, continental, and global scales. To address this limitation, we propose BRIDGE-LC (Bi-level Representation Integration for Disentangled GEospatial Land Cover), a novel deep learning framework that integrates multi-scale geospatial information into the land cover classification process. By simultaneously leveraging fine-grained (latitude/longitude) and coarse-grained (biogeographical region) spatial information, our lightweight multi-layer perceptron architecture learns from both during training but only requires fine-grained information for inference, allowing it to disentangle region-specific from region-agnostic land cover features while maintaining computational efficiency. To assess the quality of our framework, we use an open-access in-situ dataset and adopt several competing classification approaches commonly considered for large-scale land cover mapping. We evaluated all approaches through two scenarios: an extrapolation scenario in which training data encompasses samples from all biogeographical regions, and a leave-one-region-out scenario where one region is excluded from training. We also explore the spatial representation learned by our model, highlighting a connection between its internal manifold and the geographical information used during training. Our results demonstrate that integrating geospatial information improves land cover mapping performance, with the most substantial gains achieved by jointly leveraging both fine- and coarse-grained spatial information.",

State-of-the-art solutions, such as low-rank reparameterization, mitigate these issues but often struggle with generalization and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, a novel Sparse Optimization (SO) framework is proposed. Unlike low-rank approaches that typically constrain updates to a fixed subspace, our SO method leverages high sparsity to dynamically adjust very few parameters. We introduce two key paradigms. First, we advocate for \\textit{local sparsity and global density}, which updates a minimal subset of parameters per iteration while maintaining overall model expressiveness. As a second paradigm, we advocate for \\textit{local randomness and global importance}, which sparsifies the gradient using random selection while pruning the first moment based on importance. This combination significantly mitigates overfitting and ensures stable adaptation in low-data regimes. Extensive experiments on 11 diverse datasets show that SO achieves state-of-the-art few-shot adaptation performance while reducing memory overhead.",

Existing deep learning-based segmentation methods, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM), often struggle to produce segmentation results with elliptical shapes efficiently. This paper proposes a new approach to integrate the prior of elliptical shapes into the deep learning-based SAM image segmentation techniques using variational methods. The proposed method establishes a parameterized elliptical contour field, which constrains the segmentation results to align with predefined elliptical contours. Utilizing the dual algorithm, the model seamlessly integrates image features with elliptical priors and spatial regularization priors, thereby greatly enhancing segmentation accuracy. By decomposing SAM into four mathematical sub-problems, we integrate the variational ellipse prior to design a new SAM network structure, ensuring that the segmentation output of SAM consists of elliptical regions. Experimental results on some specific image datasets demonstrate an improvement over the original SAM.",

However, recent methods often overlook the fact that visual cues are susceptible, whereas the underlying geometry remains stable, rendering depth information more robust. In this paper, we investigate the potential of integrating depth information with features from VFMs, to improve the geometric consistency within an image and boost the generalization performance of VFMs. We propose a novel fine-tuning DGSS framework, named DepthForge, which integrates the visual cues from frozen DINOv2 or EVA02 and depth cues from frozen Depth Anything V2. In each layer of the VFMs, we incorporate depth-aware learnable tokens to continuously decouple domain-invariant visual and spatial information, thereby enhancing depth awareness and attention of the VFMs. Finally, we develop a depth refinement decoder and integrate it into the model architecture to adaptively refine multi-layer VFM features and depth-aware learnable tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted based on various DGSS settings and five different datsets as unseen target domains. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms alternative approaches with stronger performance, steadier visual-spatial attention, and superior generalization ability.

However, obtaining an echocardiogram requires an expert sonographer and a high-quality ultrasound imaging device, which are generally only available in hospitals. Recently, AI-based navigation models and algorithms have been used to aid novice sonographers in acquiring the standardized cardiac views necessary to visualize potential disease pathologies. These navigation systems typically rely on directional guidance to predict the necessary rotation of the ultrasound probe. This paper demonstrates a novel AI navigation system that builds on a decision model for identifying the inferior vena cava (IVC) of the heart. The decision model is trained offline using cardiac ultrasound videos and employs binary classification to determine whether the IVC is present in a given ultrasound video. The underlying model integrates a novel localization algorithm that leverages the learned feature representations to annotate the spatial location of the IVC in real-time. Our model demonstrates strong localization performance on traditional high-quality hospital ultrasound videos, as well as impressive zero-shot performance on lower-quality ultrasound videos from a more affordable Butterfly iQ handheld ultrasound machine. This capability facilitates the expansion of ultrasound diagnostics beyond hospital settings. Currently, the guidance system is undergoing clinical trials and is available on the Butterfly iQ app.",

Former end-to-end autonomous driving approaches often decouple planning and motion tasks, treating them as separate modules. This separation overlooks the potential benefits that planning can gain from learning out-of-distribution data encountered in motion tasks. However, unifying these tasks poses significant challenges, such as constructing shared contextual representations and handling the unobservability of other vehicles' states. To address these challenges, we propose TTOG, a novel two-stage trajectory generation framework. In the first stage, a diverse set of trajectory candidates is generated, while the second stage focuses on refining these candidates through vehicle state information. To mitigate the issue of unavailable surrounding vehicle states, TTOG employs a self-vehicle data-trained state estimator, subsequently extended to other vehicles. Furthermore, we introduce ECSA (equivariant context-sharing scene adapter) to enhance the generalization of scene representations across different agents. Experimental results demonstrate that TTOG achieves state-of-the-art performance across both planning and motion tasks. Notably, on the challenging open-loop nuScenes dataset, TTOG reduces the L2 distance by 36.06\\%. Furthermore, on the closed-loop Bench2Drive dataset, our approach achieves a 22\\% improvement in the driving score (DS), significantly outperforming existing baselines.",

This overwhelming specialized model production introduces new challenges for high parameter redundancy and huge storage cost, thereby necessitating the development of effective methods to consolidate and unify the capabilities of diverse powerful models into a single one. A common practice in model merging adopts static linear interpolation in the parameter space to achieve the goal of style mixing. However, it neglects the features of T2I generation task that numerous distinct models cover sundry styles which may lead to incompatibility and confusion in the merged model. To address this issue, we introduce a style-promptable image generation pipeline which can accurately generate arbitrary-style images under the control of style vectors. Based on this design, we propose the score distillation based model merging paradigm (DMM), compressing multiple models into a single versatile T2I model. Moreover, we rethink and reformulate the model merging task in the context of T2I generation, by presenting new merging goals and evaluation protocols. Our experiments demonstrate that DMM can compactly reorganize the knowledge from multiple teacher models and achieve controllable arbitrary-style generation.",

While post-disaster aerial imagery is readily available, robust debris segmentation solutions applicable across multiple disaster regions remain limited. Developing a generalized solution is challenging due to varying environmental and imaging conditions that alter debris' visual signatures across different regions, further compounded by the scarcity of training data. This study addresses these challenges by fine-tuning pre-trained foundational vision models, achieving robust performance with a relatively small, high-quality dataset. Specifically, this work introduces an open-source dataset comprising approximately 1,200 manually annotated aerial RGB images from Hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Ike. To mitigate human biases and enhance data quality, labels from multiple annotators are strategically aggregated and visual prompt engineering is employed. The resulting fine-tuned model, named fCLIPSeg, achieves a Dice score of 0.70 on data from Hurricane Ida -- a disaster event entirely excluded during training -- with virtually no false positives in debris-free areas. This work presents the first event-agnostic debris segmentation model requiring only standard RGB imagery during deployment, making it well-suited for rapid, large-scale post-disaster impact assessments and recovery planning.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2504.12899v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for video representation, enabling direct mappings from frame indices to video frames. However, existing NeRV-based methods do not fully exploit temporal redundancy, as they rely on uniform sampling along the temporal axis, leading to suboptimal rate-distortion (RD) performance. To address this limitation, we propose Tree-NeRV, a novel tree-structured feature representation for efficient and adaptive video encoding. Unlike conventional approaches, Tree-NeRV organizes feature representations within a Binary Search Tree (BST), enabling non-uniform sampling along the temporal axis. Additionally, we introduce an optimization-driven sampling strategy, dynamically allocating higher sampling density to regions with greater temporal variation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tree-NeRV achieves superior compression efficiency and reconstruction quality, outperforming prior uniform sampling-based methods. Code will be released.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2504.12696v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Collaborative perception has attracted growing interest from academia and industry due to its potential to enhance perception accuracy, safety, and robustness in autonomous driving through multi-agent information fusion. With the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, numerous collaborative perception datasets have emerged, varying in cooperation paradigms, sensor configurations, data sources, and application scenarios. However, the absence of systematic summarization and comparative analysis hinders effective resource utilization and standardization of model evaluation. As the first comprehensive review focused on collaborative perception datasets, this work reviews and compares existing resources from a multi-dimensional perspective. We categorize datasets based on cooperation paradigms, examine their data sources and scenarios, and analyze sensor modalities and supported tasks. A detailed comparative analysis is conducted across multiple dimensions. We also outline key challenges and future directions, including dataset scalability, diversity, domain adaptation, standardization, privacy, and the integration of large language models. To support ongoing research, we provide a continuously updated online repository of collaborative perception datasets and related literature: https://github.com/frankwnb/Collaborative-Perception-Datasets-for-Autonomous-Driving.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2504.13171v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key ingredient for enabling large language models (LLMs) to solve difficult problems, but comes with high latency and inference cost. We introduce sleep-time compute, which allows models to \"think\" offline about contexts before queries are presented: by anticipating what queries users might ask and pre-computing useful quantities, we can significantly reduce the compute requirements at test-time. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we create modified versions of two reasoning tasks - Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME. We find that sleep-time compute can reduce the amount of test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ~ 5x on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME and that by scaling sleep-time compute we can further increase accuracy by up to 13% on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and 18% on Stateful AIME. Furthermore, we introduce Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, which extends GSM-Symbolic by including multiple related queries per context. By amortizing sleep-time compute across related queries about the same context using Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, we can decrease the average cost per query by 2.5x. We then conduct additional analysis to understand when sleep-time compute is most effective, finding the predictability of the user query to be well correlated with the efficacy of sleep-time compute. Finally, we conduct a case-study of applying sleep-time compute to a realistic agentic SWE task.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2504.13145v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential as agents, excelling at tasks that require multiple rounds of reasoning and interactions. Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as an effective method for finetuning LLMs as agents: it first imitates expert-generated successful trajectories and further improves agentic skills through iterative fine-tuning on successful, self-generated trajectories. However, since the expert (e.g., GPT-4) succeeds primarily on simpler subtasks and RFT inherently favors simpler scenarios, many complex subtasks remain unsolved and persistently out-of-distribution (OOD). Upon investigating these challenging subtasks, we discovered that previously failed expert trajectories can often provide valuable guidance, e.g., plans and key actions, that can significantly improve agent exploration efficiency and acquisition of critical skills. Motivated by these observations, we propose Exploring Expert Failures (EEF), which identifies beneficial actions from failed expert trajectories and integrates them into the training dataset. Potentially harmful actions are meticulously excluded to prevent contamination of the model learning process. By leveraging the beneficial actions in expert failures, EEF successfully solves some previously unsolvable subtasks and improves agent tuning performance. Remarkably, our approach achieved a 62\\% win rate in WebShop, outperforming RFT (53. 6\\%) and GPT-4 (35. 6\\%), and to the best of our knowledge, setting a new state-of-the-art as the first method to surpass a score of 0.81 in WebShop and exceed 81 in SciWorld.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2504.12612v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Provenance is the chronology of things, resonating with the fundamental pursuit to uncover origins, trace connections, and situate entities within the flow of space and time. As artificial intelligence advances towards autonomous agents capable of interactive collaboration on complex tasks, the provenance of generated content becomes entangled in the interplay of collective creation, where contributions are continuously revised, extended or overwritten. In a multi-agent generative chain, content undergoes successive transformations, often leaving little, if any, trace of prior contributions. In this study, we investigates the problem of tracking multi-agent provenance across the temporal dimension of generation. We propose a chronological system for post hoc attribution of generative history from content alone, without reliance on internal memory states or external meta-information. At its core lies the notion of symbolic chronicles, representing signed and time-stamped records, in a form analogous to the chain of custody in forensic science. The system operates through a feedback loop, whereby each generative timestep updates the chronicle of prior interactions and synchronises it with the synthetic content in the very act of generation. This research seeks to develop an accountable form of collaborative artificial intelligence within evolving cyber ecosystems.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2504.12970v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Anomaly detection is a crucial task in computer vision, yet collecting real-world defect images is inherently difficult due to the rarity and unpredictability of anomalies. Consequently, researchers have turned to synthetic methods for training data augmentation. However, existing synthetic strategies (e.g., naive cut-and-paste or inpainting) overlook the underlying physical causes of defects, leading to inconsistent, low-fidelity anomalies that hamper model generalization to real-world complexities. In this thesis, we introduced a novel pipeline that generates synthetic anomalies through Math-Physics model guidance, refines them via a Coarse-to-Fine approach and employs a bi-level optimization strategy with a Synthesis Quality Estimator(SQE). By incorporating physical modeling of cracks, corrosion, and deformation, our method produces realistic defect masks, which are subsequently enhanced in two phases. The first stage (npcF) enforces a PDE-based consistency to achieve a globally coherent anomaly structure, while the second stage (npcF++) further improves local fidelity using wavelet transforms and boundary synergy blocks. Additionally, we leverage SQE-driven weighting, ensuring that high-quality synthetic samples receive greater emphasis during training. To validate our approach, we conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely adopted industrial anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD. Across these datasets, the proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in both image-AUROC and pixel-AUROC, confirming the effectiveness of our MaPhC2F and BiSQAD.",

Our method performs targeted data transformations by applying random noise perturbations to foreground objects and spatially shuffling background patches. This effectively increases the diversity of the training data, improving model robustness and generalization. Evaluations on the PACS dataset for SFDA demonstrate that our augmentation strategy consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements in both single-target and multi-target adaptation settings. By augmenting training data through structured transformations, our method enables model generalization across domains, providing a scalable solution for reducing reliance on manually annotated datasets. Furthermore, experiments on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach for person ReID, surpassing traditional augmentation techniques.",
