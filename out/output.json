        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.13130v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present Magma, a foundation model that serves multimodal AI agentic tasks in both the digital and physical worlds. Magma is a significant extension of vision-language (VL) models in that it not only retains the VL understanding ability (verbal intelligence) of the latter, but is also equipped with the ability to plan and act in the visual-spatial world (spatial-temporal intelligence) and complete agentic tasks ranging from UI navigation to robot manipulation. To endow the agentic capabilities, Magma is pretrained on large amounts of heterogeneous datasets spanning from images, videos to robotics data, where the actionable visual objects (e.g., clickable buttons in GUI) in images are labeled by Set-of-Mark (SoM) for action grounding, and the object movements (e.g., the trace of human hands or robotic arms) in videos are labeled by Trace-of-Mark (ToM) for action planning. Extensive experiments show that SoM and ToM reach great synergy and facilitate the acquisition of spatial-temporal intelligence for our Magma model, which is fundamental to a wide range of tasks as shown in Fig.1. In particular, Magma creates new state-of-the-art results on UI navigation and robotic manipulation tasks, outperforming previous models that are specifically tailored to these tasks. On image and video-related multimodal tasks, Magma also compares favorably to popular large multimodal models that are trained on much larger datasets. We make our model and code public for reproducibility at https://microsoft.github.io/Magma.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.12488v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans interpret and perceive the world by integrating sensory information from multiple modalities, such as vision and hearing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as brain-inspired computational models, exhibit unique advantages in emulating the brain's information processing mechanisms. However, existing SNN models primarily focus on unimodal processing and lack efficient cross-modal information fusion, thereby limiting their effectiveness in real-world multimodal scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-alignment cross-modal residual learning (S-CMRL) framework, a Transformer-based multimodal SNN architecture designed for effective audio-visual integration. S-CMRL leverages a spatiotemporal spiking attention mechanism to extract complementary features across modalities, and incorporates a cross-modal residual learning strategy to enhance feature integration. Additionally, a semantic alignment optimization mechanism is introduced to align cross-modal features within a shared semantic space, improving their consistency and complementarity. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets CREMA-D, UrbanSound8K-AV, and MNISTDVS-NTIDIGITS demonstrate that S-CMRL significantly outperforms existing multimodal SNN methods, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

We propose mmMamba, a framework for developing linear-complexity native multimodal state space models through progressive distillation from existing MLLMs using moderate academic computational resources. Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only MLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained RNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba from trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can effectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving multimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures that combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable efficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based decoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against existing linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further improves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K tokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6$\\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory reduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\\times$ speedup and 60.2% memory savings.

To overcome these challenges, our approach (IM360) leverages the wide field of view of omnidirectional images and integrates the spherical camera model into every core component of the SfM pipeline. In order to develop a comprehensive 3D reconstruction solution, we integrate a neural implicit surface reconstruction technique to generate high-quality surfaces from sparse input data. Additionally, we utilize a mesh-based neural rendering approach to refine texture maps and accurately capture view-dependent properties by combining diffuse and specular components. We evaluate our pipeline on large-scale indoor scenes from the Matterport3D and Stanford2D3D datasets. In practice, IM360 demonstrate superior performance in terms of textured mesh reconstruction over SOTA.

Existing detection methods achieve strong performance but rely heavily on expensive API calls and iterative LVLM-based validation, making them impractical for large-scale or offline use. To address these limitations, we propose CutPaste\\&Find, a lightweight and training-free framework for detecting hallucinations in LVLM-generated outputs. Our approach leverages off-the-shelf visual and linguistic modules to perform multi-step verification efficiently without requiring LVLM inference. At the core of our framework is a Visual-aid Knowledge Base that encodes rich entity-attribute relationships and associated image representations. We introduce a scaling factor to refine similarity scores, mitigating the issue of suboptimal alignment values even for ground-truth image-text pairs.

But understanding physical properties like mass, friction, and hardness, in the wild, remains challenging. We propose a new method that reconstructs 3D objects using the Gaussian splatting representation and predicts various physical properties in a zero-shot manner. We propose two techniques during the reconstruction phase: a geometry-aware regularization loss function to improve the shape quality and a region-aware feature contrastive loss function to promote region affinity. Two other new techniques are designed during inference: a feature-based property propagation module and a volume integration module tailored for the Gaussian representation. Our framework is named as zero-shot physical understanding with Gaussian splatting, or PUGS. PUGS achieves new state-of-the-art results on the standard benchmark of ABO-500 mass prediction.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.12791v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Due to the similar characteristics between event-based visual data and point clouds, recent studies have emerged that treat event data as event clouds to learn based on point cloud analysis. Additionally, some works approach point clouds from the perspective of event vision, employing Spiking Neural Network (SNN) due to their asynchronous nature. However, these contributions are often domain-specific, making it difficult to extend their applicability to other intersecting fields. Moreover, while SNN-based visual tasks have seen significant growth, the conventional timestep-wise iterative activation strategy largely limits their real-world applications by large timesteps, resulting in significant delays and increased computational costs. Although some innovative methods achieve good performance with short timesteps (<10), few have fundamentally restructured the update strategy of spiking neurons to completely overcome the limitations of timesteps. In response to these concerns, we propose a novel and general activation strategy for spiking neurons called Activation-wise Membrane Potential Propagation (AMP2). This approach extends the concept of timesteps from a manually crafted parameter within the activation function to any existing network structure. In experiments on common point cloud tasks (classification, object, and scene segmentation) and event cloud tasks (action recognition), we found that AMP2 stabilizes SNN training, maintains competitive performance, and reduces latency compared to the traditional timestep-wise activation paradigm.",

Dense T2I (DT2I) and spherical T2I (ST2I) models address these issues, but so far no unified approach exists. Trivial approaches, like prompting a DT2I model to generate panoramas can not generate proper spherical distortions and seamless transitions at the borders. Our work shows that spherical dense text-to-image (SDT2I) can be achieved by integrating training-free DT2I approaches into finetuned panorama models. Specifically, we propose MultiStitchDiffusion (MSTD) and MultiPanFusion (MPF) by integrating MultiDiffusion into StitchDiffusion and PanFusion, respectively. Since no benchmark for SDT2I exists, we further construct Dense-Synthetic-View (DSynView), a new synthetic dataset containing spherical layouts to evaluate our models. Our results show that MSTD outperforms MPF across image quality as well as prompt- and layout adherence. MultiPanFusion generates more diverse images but struggles to synthesize flawless foreground objects. We propose bootstrap-coupling and turning off equirectangular perspective-projection attention in the foreground as an improvement of MPF.",

We demonstrate human-like speech synthesis, synchronized lip motion, lively facial expressions and head pose; all generated from just text characters. The core premise of our approach lies in the architecture of our two parallel diffusion transformers. Intermediate highway connections ensure communication between the audio and visual modalities, and thus, synchronized speech intonation and facial dynamics (e.g., eyebrow motion). Our model is trained with flow matching, leading to expressive results and fast inference. In case of dyadic conversations, AV-Flow produces an always-on avatar, that actively listens and reacts to the audio-visual input of a user.

Synthesizing sustained footage (e.g. over minutes) still remains an open research question. In this paper, we propose MALT Diffusion (using Memory-Augmented Latent Transformers), a new diffusion model specialized for long video generation. MALT Diffusion (or just MALT) handles long videos by subdividing them into short segments and doing segment-level autoregressive generation. To achieve this, we first propose recurrent attention layers that encode multiple segments into a compact memory latent vector; by maintaining this memory vector over time, MALT is able to condition on it and continuously generate new footage based on a long temporal context. We also present several training techniques that enable the model to generate frames over a long horizon with consistent quality and minimal degradation. We validate the effectiveness of MALT through experiments on long video benchmarks. We first perform extensive analysis of MALT in long-contextual understanding capability and stability using popular long video benchmarks. For example, MALT achieves an FVD score of 220.4 on 128-frame video generation on UCF-101, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of 648.4. Finally, we explore MALT's capabilities in a text-to-video generation setting and show that it can produce long videos compared with recent techniques for long text-to-video generation.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.13006v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automated Planning algorithms require a model of the domain that specifies the preconditions and effects of each action. Obtaining such a domain model is notoriously hard. Algorithms for learning domain models exist, yet it remains unclear whether learning a domain model and planning is an effective approach for numeric planning environments, i.e., where states include discrete and numeric state variables. In this work, we explore the benefits of learning a numeric domain model and compare it with alternative model-free solutions. As a case study, we use two tasks in Minecraft, a popular sandbox game that has been used as an AI challenge. First, we consider an offline learning setting, where a set of expert trajectories are available to learn from. This is the standard setting for learning domain models. We used the Numeric Safe Action Model Learning (NSAM) algorithm to learn a numeric domain model and solve new problems with the learned domain model and a numeric planner. We call this model-based solution NSAM_(+p), and compare it to several model-free Imitation Learning (IL) and Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Empirical results show that some IL algorithms can learn faster to solve simple tasks, while NSAM_(+p) allows solving tasks that require long-term planning and enables generalizing to solve problems in larger environments. Then, we consider an online learning setting, where learning is done by moving an agent in the environment. For this setting, we introduce RAMP. In RAMP, observations collected during the agent's execution are used to simultaneously train an RL policy and learn a planning domain action model. This forms a positive feedback loop between the RL policy and the learned domain model. We demonstrate experimentally the benefits of using RAMP, showing that it finds more efficient plans and solves more problems than several RL baselines.",

However, we reveal a fundamental limitation: existing SAEs exhibit severe instability, as identical models trained on similar datasets can produce sharply different dictionaries, undermining their reliability as an interpretability tool. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the Archetypal Analysis framework introduced by Cutler & Breiman (1994) and present Archetypal SAEs (A-SAE), wherein dictionary atoms are constrained to the convex hull of data. This geometric anchoring significantly enhances the stability of inferred dictionaries, and their mildly relaxed variants RA-SAEs further match state-of-the-art reconstruction abilities. To rigorously assess dictionary quality learned by SAEs, we introduce two new benchmarks that test (i) plausibility, if dictionaries recover \"true\" classification directions and (ii) identifiability, if dictionaries disentangle synthetic concept mixtures. Across all evaluations, RA-SAEs consistently yield more structured representations while uncovering novel, semantically meaningful concepts in large-scale vision models.",

These methods retrieve useful moments from long videos for their presented tasks, thereby enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate high-quality answers in a cost-effective way. In this work, we present MomentSeeker, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate retrieval models' performance in handling general long-video moment retrieval (LVMR) tasks. MomentSeeker offers three key advantages. First, it incorporates long videos of over 500 seconds on average, making it the first benchmark specialized for long-video moment retrieval. Second, it covers a wide range of task categories (including Moment Search, Caption Alignment, Image-conditioned Moment Search, and Video-conditioned Moment Search) and diverse application scenarios (e.g., sports, movies, cartoons, and ego), making it a comprehensive tool for assessing retrieval models' general LVMR performance. Additionally, the evaluation tasks are carefully curated through human annotation, ensuring the reliability of assessment. We further fine-tune an MLLM-based LVMR retriever on synthetic data, which demonstrates strong performance on our benchmark. We perform extensive experiments with various popular multimodal retrievers based on our benchmark, whose results highlight the challenges of LVMR and limitations for existing methods.

While prior works focus on dataset refinement through high-quality data collection or rule-based filtering, they are costly or limited to specific types of corruption. To deeply understand how corrupted data affects MLLMs, in this paper, we systematically investigate this issue and find that while corrupted data degrades the performance of MLLMs, its effects are largely superficial in that the performance of MLLMs can be largely restored by either disabling a small subset of parameters or post-training with a small amount of clean data. Additionally, corrupted MLLMs exhibit improved ability to distinguish clean samples from corrupted ones, enabling the dataset cleaning without external help. Based on those insights, we propose a corruption-robust training paradigm combining self-validation and post-training, which significantly outperforms existing corruption mitigation strategies.",

Despite their impressive performance, VLMs are prone to significant hallucinations, particularly in the form of cross-modal inconsistencies. Building on the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning LLMs, recent advancements have focused on applying direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated datasets to mitigate these issues. Yet, such approaches typically introduce preference signals in a brute-force manner, neglecting the crucial role of visual information in the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Re-Align, a novel alignment framework that leverages image retrieval to construct a dual-preference dataset, effectively incorporating both textual and visual preference signals. We further introduce rDPO, an extension of the standard direct preference optimization that incorporates an additional visual preference objective during fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Re-Align not only mitigates hallucinations more effectively than previous methods but also yields significant performance gains in general visual question-answering (VQA) tasks. Moreover, we show that Re-Align maintains robustness and scalability across a wide range of VLM sizes and architectures. This work represents a significant step forward in aligning multimodal LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and effective cross-modal applications.

To uncover the root cause of this phenomenon, we conduct an in-depth analysis and identify a key issue: multimodal inputs introduce an modality-induced activation shift toward a \"safer\" direction compared to their text-only counterparts, leading VLMs to systematically overestimate the safety of harmful inputs. We refer to this issue as safety perception distortion. To mitigate such distortion, we propose Activation Shift Disentanglement and Calibration (ShiftDC), a training-free method that decomposes and calibrates the modality-induced activation shift to reduce the impact of modality on safety. By isolating and removing the safety-relevant component, ShiftDC restores the inherent safety alignment of the LLM backbone while preserving the vision-language capabilities of VLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that ShiftDC significantly enhances alignment performance on safety benchmarks without impairing model utility.",

Existing splatting-based approaches often produce distorted geometry due to splatting errors. While diffusion-based methods leverage rich 3D priors to achieve improved geometry, they often suffer from texture hallucination. In this paper, we introduce SplatDiff, a pixel-splatting-guided video diffusion model designed to synthesize high-fidelity novel views from a single image. Specifically, we propose an aligned synthesis strategy for precise control of target viewpoints and geometry-consistent view synthesis. To mitigate texture hallucination, we design a texture bridge module that enables high-fidelity texture generation through adaptive feature fusion. In this manner, SplatDiff leverages the strengths of splatting and diffusion to generate novel views with consistent geometry and high-fidelity details. Extensive experiments verify the state-of-the-art performance of SplatDiff in single-view NVS. Additionally, without extra training, SplatDiff shows remarkable zero-shot performance across diverse tasks, including sparse-view NVS and stereo video conversion.",

Inspired by recent advancements in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) and Contrastive Learning (CL) methodologies, this research aims to develop CL methodologies to translate implicit knowledge in VFM into change representations, thus eliminating the need for explicit supervision. To this end, we introduce a Semantic-to-Change (S2C) learning framework for UCD in both homogeneous and multimodal RS images. Differently from existing CL methodologies that typically focus on learning multi-temporal similarities, we introduce a novel triplet learning strategy that explicitly models temporal differences, which are crucial to the CD task. Furthermore, random spatial and spectral perturbations are introduced during the training to enhance robustness to temporal noise. In addition, a grid sparsity regularization is defined to suppress insignificant changes, and an IoU-matching algorithm is developed to refine the CD results. Experiments on four benchmark CD datasets demonstrate that the proposed S2C learning framework achieves significant improvements in accuracy, surpassing current state-of-the-art by over 31\\%, 9\\%, 23\\%, and 15\\%, respectively. It also demonstrates robustness and sample efficiency, suitable for training and adaptation of various Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) or backbone neural networks.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.12640v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current text-to-3D generation methods based on score distillation often suffer from geometric inconsistencies, leading to repeated patterns across different poses of 3D assets. This issue, known as the Multi-Face Janus problem, arises because existing methods struggle to maintain consistency across varying poses and are biased toward a canonical pose. While recent work has improved pose control and approximation, these efforts are still limited by this inherent bias, which skews the guidance during generation. To address this, we propose a solution called RecDreamer, which reshapes the underlying data distribution to achieve a more consistent pose representation. The core idea behind our method is to rectify the prior distribution, ensuring that pose variation is uniformly distributed rather than biased toward a canonical form. By modifying the prescribed distribution through an auxiliary function, we can reconstruct the density of the distribution to ensure compliance with specific marginal constraints. In particular, we ensure that the marginal distribution of poses follows a uniform distribution, thereby eliminating the biases introduced by the prior knowledge. We incorporate this rectified data distribution into existing score distillation algorithms, a process we refer to as uniform score distillation. To efficiently compute the posterior distribution required for the auxiliary function, RecDreamer introduces a training-free classifier that estimates pose categories in a plug-and-play manner. Additionally, we utilize various approximation techniques for noisy states, significantly improving system performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that RecDreamer effectively mitigates the Multi-Face Janus problem, leading to more consistent 3D asset generation across different poses.",

In this study, we investigate the use of synthetic data in robotics and navigation, specifically focusing on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR). In particular, we introduce a synthetic dataset created using the virtual environment of the video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), along with an algorithm designed to generate a VPR dataset, without human supervision. Through a series of experiments centered on SLAM and VPR, we demonstrate that synthetic data derived from GTA V are qualitatively comparable to real-world data. Furthermore, these synthetic data can complement or even substitute real-world data in these applications.

The task aims to infer objects' physics commonsense based on both video and audio input, with the main challenge being how to imitate the reasoning ability of humans, even under the scenario of missing modalities. Most of the current methods fail to take full advantage of different characteristics in multi-modal data, and lacking causal reasoning ability in models impedes the progress of implicit physical knowledge inferring. To address these issues, our proposed RDCL method decouples videos into static (time-invariant) and dynamic (time-varying) factors in the latent space by the disentangled sequential encoder, which adopts a variational autoencoder (VAE) to maximize the mutual information with a contrastive loss function. Furthermore, we introduce a counterfactual learning module to augment the model's reasoning ability by modeling physical knowledge relationships among different objects under counterfactual intervention. To alleviate the incomplete modality data issue, we introduce a robust multimodal learning method to recover the missing data by decomposing the shared features and model-specific features. Our proposed method is a plug-and-play module that can be incorporated into any baseline including VLMs. In experiments, we show that our proposed method improves the reasoning accuracy and robustness of baseline methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",

Existing studies emphasized that the strong language priors of LVLMs can overpower visual information, causing hallucinations. However, the positive role of language priors is the key to a powerful LVLM. If the language priors are too weak, LVLMs will struggle to leverage rich parameter knowledge and instruction understanding abilities to complete tasks in challenging visual scenarios where visual information alone is insufficient. Therefore, we propose a benchmark called LanP to rethink the impact of Language Priors in LVLMs. It is designed to investigate how strong language priors are in current LVLMs. LanP consists of 170 images and 340 corresponding well-designed questions. Extensive experiments on 25 popular LVLMs reveal that many LVLMs' language priors are not strong enough to effectively aid question answering when objects are partially hidden.

To fully leverage these unpaired documents, we initially establish a Real-World Data Extraction pipeline to extract high-quality images and texts. Then we design a hierarchical retrieval method to efficiently associate each image with multiple semantically relevant realistic texts. To further enhance fine-grained visual information, we propose an image semantic augmented generation module for synthetic text production. Furthermore, we employ a semantic balance sampling strategy to improve dataset diversity, enabling better learning of long-tail concepts.

In this paper, we endeavor on a scarcely explored task named Gaseous Object Detection (GOD), which is undertaken to explore whether the object detection techniques can be extended from solid substances to gaseous substances. Nevertheless, the gas exhibits significantly different visual characteristics: 1) saliency deficiency, 2) arbitrary and ever-changing shapes, 3) lack of distinct boundaries.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.13081v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have significantly facilitated the development of personalized content creation. Given a small set of images with user-specific concept, personalized image generation allows to create images that incorporate the specified concept and adhere to provided text descriptions. Due to its wide applications in content creation, significant effort has been devoted to this field in recent years. Nonetheless, the technologies used for personalization have evolved alongside the development of generative models, with their distinct and interrelated components. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of generalized personalized image generation across various generative models, including traditional GANs, contemporary text-to-image diffusion models, and emerging multi-model autoregressive models. We first define a unified framework that standardizes the personalization process across different generative models, encompassing three key components, i.e., inversion spaces, inversion methods, and personalization schemes. This unified framework offers a structured approach to dissecting and comparing personalization techniques across different generative architectures. Building upon this unified framework, we further provide an in-depth analysis of personalization techniques within each generative model, highlighting their unique contributions and innovations. Through comparative analysis, this survey elucidates the current landscape of personalized image generation, identifying commonalities and distinguishing features among existing methods. Finally, we discuss the open challenges in the field and propose potential directions for future research.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.13131v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding human preferences is crucial for improving foundation models and building personalized AI systems. However, preferences are inherently diverse and complex, making it difficult for traditional reward models to capture their full range. While fine-grained preference data can help, collecting it is expensive and hard to scale. In this paper, we introduce Decomposed Reward Models (DRMs), a novel approach that extracts diverse human preferences from binary comparisons without requiring fine-grained annotations. Our key insight is to represent human preferences as vectors and analyze them using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By constructing a dataset of embedding differences between preferred and rejected responses, DRMs identify orthogonal basis vectors that capture distinct aspects of preference. These decomposed rewards can be flexibly combined to align with different user needs, offering an interpretable and scalable alternative to traditional reward models. We demonstrate that DRMs effectively extract meaningful preference dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, safety, humor) and adapt to new users without additional training. Our results highlight DRMs as a powerful framework for personalized and interpretable LLM alignment.",

While existing research expands LLMs access to diverse tools (e.g., program interpreters, search engines, weather/map apps), the necessity of using these tools is often overlooked, leading to indiscriminate tool invocation. This naive approach raises two key issues:(1) increased delays due to unnecessary tool calls, and (2) potential errors resulting from faulty interactions with external tools. In this paper, we introduce meta-cognition as a proxy for LLMs self-assessment of their capabilities, representing the model's awareness of its own limitations. Based on this, we propose MeCo, an adaptive decision-making strategy for external tool use. MeCo quantifies metacognitive scores by capturing high-level cognitive signals in the representation space, guiding when to invoke tools. Notably, MeCo is fine-tuning-free and incurs minimal cost. Our experiments show that MeCo accurately detects LLMs' internal cognitive signals and significantly improves tool-use decision-making across multiple base models and benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.12450v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Homans' Social Exchange Theory (SET) is widely recognized as a basic framework for understanding the formation and emergence of human civilizations and social structures. In social science, this theory is typically studied based on simple simulation experiments or real-world human studies, both of which either lack realism or are too expensive to control. In artificial intelligence, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in simulating human behaviors. Inspired by these insights, we adopt an interdisciplinary research perspective and propose using LLM-based agents to study Homans' SET. Specifically, we construct a virtual society composed of three LLM agents and have them engage in a social exchange game to observe their behaviors. Through extensive experiments, we found that Homans' SET is well validated in our agent society, demonstrating the consistency between the agent and human behaviors. Building on this foundation, we intentionally alter the settings of the agent society to extend the traditional Homans' SET, making it more comprehensive and detailed. To the best of our knowledge, this paper marks the first step in studying Homans' SET with LLM-based agents. More importantly, it introduces a novel and feasible research paradigm that bridges the fields of social science and computer science through LLM-based agents.

To our surprise, most models exhibit graceful degradation, and in some cases, they even perform better without noise conditioning. We provide a theoretical analysis of the error caused by removing noise conditioning and demonstrate that our analysis aligns with empirical observations.

These annotations are then transformed into 3D pseudo-labels for training of a 3D convolutional neural network, circumventing the creation of manual 3D masks. For pseudo-label creation in the bifurcation area we propose the use of cross-sections perpendicular to the bifurcation axis and show that this enhances segmentation performance.

Recently, some more aligned models have demonstrated higher resiliency to adversarial examples, raising the question of whether more human-aligned models are inherently more secure. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical analysis to systematically investigate the relationship between representational alignment and adversarial robustness. We evaluate 118 models spanning diverse architectures and training paradigms, measuring their neural and behavioral alignment and engineering task performance across 106 benchmarks as well as their adversarial robustness via AutoAttack. Our findings reveal that while average alignment and robustness exhibit a weak overall correlation, specific alignment benchmarks serve as strong predictors of adversarial robustness, particularly those that measure selectivity towards texture or shape. These results suggest that different forms of alignment play distinct roles in model robustness, motivating further investigation into how alignment-driven approaches can be leveraged to build more secure and perceptually-grounded vision models.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.12224v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, and their application in edge scenarios has attracted significant attention. However, sparse-activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which are well suited for edge scenarios, have received relatively little attention due to their high memory demands. Offload-based methods have been proposed to address this challenge, but they face difficulties with expert prediction. Inaccurate expert predictions can result in prolonged inference delays. To promote the application of MoE models in edge scenarios, we propose Fate, an offloading system designed for MoE models to enable efficient inference in resource-constrained environments. The key insight behind Fate is that gate inputs from adjacent layers can be effectively used for expert prefetching, achieving high prediction accuracy without additional GPU overhead. Furthermore, Fate employs a shallow-favoring expert caching strategy that increases the expert hit rate to 99\\%. Additionally, Fate integrates tailored quantization strategies for cache optimization and IO efficiency. Experimental results show that, compared to Load on Demand and Expert Activation Path-based method, Fate achieves up to 4.5x and 1.9x speedups in prefill speed and up to 4.1x and 2.2x speedups in decoding speed, respectively, while maintaining inference quality.

To address this issue, we introduce Cor2Vox, the first diffusion model-based method that translates continuous cortical shape priors to synthetic brain MRIs. To achieve this, we leverage a Brownian bridge process which allows for direct structured mapping between shape contours and medical images. Specifically, we adapt the concept of the Brownian bridge diffusion model to 3D and extend it to embrace various complementary shape representations. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in the geometric accuracy of reconstructed structures compared to previous voxel-based approaches. Moreover, Cor2Vox excels in image quality and diversity, yielding high variation in non-target structures like the skull. Finally, we highlight the capability of our approach to simulate cortical atrophy at the sub-voxel level. Our code is available at https://github.com/ai-med/Cor2Vox.",

This method processes the input image into a series of small patches. However, because of the strong correlation between different facial components in facial images. When it comes to super-resolution of low-resolution images, existing algorithms cannot handle the relationships between patches well, resulting in distorted facial components in the super-resolution results. To solve the problem, we propose a transformer architecture based on graph neural networks called graph vision transformer network. We treat each patch as a graph node and establish an adjacency matrix based on the information between patches. In this way, the patch only interacts between neighboring patches, further processing the relationship of facial components. Quantitative and visualization experiments have underscored the superiority of our algorithm over state-of-the-art techniques. Through detailed comparisons, we have demonstrated that our algorithm possesses more advanced super-resolution capabilities, particularly in enhancing facial components.

Existing work is focused on fully migrating diffusion models to SR tasks. The diffusion model is proposed in the field of image generation, so in order to make the generated results diverse, the diffusion model combines random Gaussian noise and distributed sampling to increase the randomness of the model.   However, the essence of super-resolution tasks requires the model to generate high-resolution images with fidelity. Excessive addition of random factors can result in the model generating detailed information that does not belong to the HR image. To address this issue, we propose a new diffusion model called Deltadiff, which uses only residuals between images for diffusion, making the entire diffusion process more stable.

Existing high precision solutions rely on expensive, tag-dependent hardware, while vision-based methods offer a cheaper, tag-free alternative. However, current vision solutions based on stereo vision face limitations due to rigid perspective transformation principles and error propagation in multi-stage SVD solvers. These solutions also require multiple high-resolution cameras with strict setup constraints.To address these limitations, we propose a probabilistic approach that considers all points on the human body as observations generated by a distribution centered around the body's geometric center. This enables us to improve sampling significantly, increasing the number of samples for each point of interest from hundreds to billions. By modeling the relation between the means of the distributions of world coordinates and pixel coordinates, leveraging the Central Limit Theorem, we ensure normality and facilitate the learning process. Experimental results demonstrate human localization accuracy of 96\\% within a 0.3$m$ range and nearly 100\\% accuracy within a 0.5$m$ range, achieved at a low cost of only 10 USD using two web cameras with a resolution of 640$\\times$480 pixels.",

To address these challenges, we propose TI-Net, a highly versatile visual Network backbone designed to construct a Transformation Isomorphic latent space. Specifically, we employ linear transformations to model geometric transformations in the latent space and ensure that {\\rm TI-Net} aligns them with those in the image space. This ensures that the latent features capture compact, low-level information beneficial for pose estimation tasks. We evaluated TI-Net on the hand pose estimation task to demonstrate the network's superiority.

Here, we first analyze why SNN-based ViTs suffer from limited performance and identify a mismatch between the vanilla self-attention mechanism and spatio-temporal spike trains. This mismatch results in degraded spatial relevance and limited temporal interactions. To address these issues, we draw inspiration from biological saccadic attention mechanisms and introduce an innovative Saccadic Spike Self-Attention (SSSA) method. Specifically, in the spatial domain, SSSA employs a novel spike distribution-based method to effectively assess the relevance between Query and Key pairs in SNN-based ViTs. Temporally, SSSA employs a saccadic interaction module that dynamically focuses on selected visual areas at each timestep and significantly enhances whole scene understanding through temporal interactions. Building on the SSSA mechanism, we develop a SNN-based Vision Transformer (SNN-ViT). Extensive experiments across various visual tasks demonstrate that SNN-ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance with linear computational complexity. The effectiveness and efficiency of the SNN-ViT highlight its potential for power-critical edge vision applications.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.12600v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge for low-level vision models, which often struggle with unseen degradations in real-world scenarios despite their success in controlled benchmarks. In this paper, we revisit the generalization problem in low-level vision models. Image deraining is selected as a case study due to its well-defined and easily decoupled structure, allowing for more effective observation and analysis. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that the generalization issue is not primarily due to limited network capacity but rather the failure of existing training strategies, which leads networks to overfit specific degradation patterns. Our findings show that guiding networks to focus on learning the underlying image content, rather than the degradation patterns, is key to improving generalization. We demonstrate that balancing the complexity of background images and degradations in the training data helps networks better fit the image distribution. Furthermore, incorporating content priors from pre-trained generative models significantly enhances generalization. Experiments on both image deraining and image denoising validate the proposed strategies. We believe the insights and solutions will inspire further research and improve the generalization of low-level vision models.",

        "title": "Exploring the Impact of Personality Traits on LLM Bias and Toxicity",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.12566v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the different roles that AI is expected to play in human life, imbuing large language models (LLMs) with different personalities has attracted increasing research interests. While the \"personification\" enhances human experiences of interactivity and adaptability of LLMs, it gives rise to critical concerns about content safety, particularly regarding bias, sentiment and toxicity of LLM generation. This study explores how assigning different personality traits to LLMs affects the toxicity and biases of their outputs. Leveraging the widely accepted HEXACO personality framework developed in social psychology, we design experimentally sound prompts to test three LLMs' performance on three toxic and bias benchmarks. The findings demonstrate the sensitivity of all three models to HEXACO personality traits and, more importantly, a consistent variation in the biases, negative sentiment and toxicity of their output. In particular, adjusting the levels of several personality traits can effectively reduce bias and toxicity in model performance, similar to humans' correlations between personality traits and toxic behaviors. The findings highlight the additional need to examine content safety besides the efficiency of training or fine-tuning methods for LLM personification. They also suggest a potential for the adjustment of personalities to be a simple and low-cost method to conduct controlled text generation.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.12582v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In real-world action recognition systems, incorporating more attributes helps achieve a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior. However, using a single model to simultaneously recognize multiple attributes can lead to a decrease in accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel method i.e. Adaptive Attribute Prototype Model (AAPM) for human action recognition, which captures rich action-relevant attribute information and strikes a balance between accuracy and robustness. Firstly, we introduce the Text-Constrain Module (TCM) to incorporate textual information from potential labels, and constrain the construction of different attributes prototype representations. In addition, we explore the Attribute Assignment Method (AAM) to address the issue of training bias and increase robustness during the training process.Furthermore, we construct a new video dataset with attribute-based multi-label called Multi-Kinetics for evaluation, which contains various attribute labels (e.g. action, scene, object, etc.) related to human behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AAPM achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both attribute-based multi-label few-shot action recognition and single-label few-shot action recognition.

The streaming gesture recognition framework, Duo Streamers, proposed in this paper, addresses these challenges through a three-stage sparse recognition mechanism, an RNN-lite model with an external hidden state, and specialized training and post-processing pipelines, thereby making innovative progress in real-time performance and lightweight design. Experimental results show that Duo Streamers matches mainstream methods in accuracy metrics, while reducing the real-time factor by approximately 92.3%, i.e., delivering a nearly 13-fold speedup. In addition, the framework shrinks parameter counts to 1/38 (idle state) and 1/9 (busy state) compared to mainstream models. In summary, Duo Streamers not only offers an efficient and practical solution for streaming gesture recognition in resource-constrained devices but also lays a solid foundation for extended applications in multimodal and diverse scenarios.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.12917v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to detect event timestamps described by the natural language query from given untrimmed videos. The existing fully-supervised setting achieves great results but requires expensive annotation costs; while the weakly-supervised setting adopts cheap labels but performs poorly. To pursue high performance with less annotation costs, this paper introduces an intermediate partially-supervised setting, i.e., only short-clip is available during training. To make full use of partial labels, we specially design one contrast-unity framework, with the two-stage goal of implicit-explicit progressive grounding. In the implicit stage, we align event-query representations at fine granularity using comprehensive quadruple contrastive learning: event-query gather, event-background separation, intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster separability. Then, high-quality representations bring acceptable grounding pseudo-labels. In the explicit stage, to explicitly optimize grounding objectives, we train one fully-supervised model using obtained pseudo-labels for grounding refinement and denoising. Extensive experiments and thoroughly ablations on Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions demonstrate the significance of partial supervision, as well as our superior performance.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2502.13023v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Palms are ecologically and economically indicators of tropical forest health, biodiversity, and human impact that support local economies and global forest product supply chains. While palm detection in plantations is well-studied, efforts to map naturally occurring palms in dense forests remain limited by overlapping crowns, uneven shading, and heterogeneous landscapes. We develop PRISM (Processing, Inference, Segmentation, and Mapping), a flexible pipeline for detecting and localizing palms in dense tropical forests using large orthomosaic images. Orthomosaics are created from thousands of aerial images and spanning several to hundreds of gigabytes. Our contributions are threefold. First, we construct a large UAV-derived orthomosaic dataset collected across 21 ecologically diverse sites in western Ecuador, annotated with 8,830 bounding boxes and 5,026 palm center points. Second, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art object detectors based on efficiency and performance, integrating zero-shot SAM 2 as the segmentation backbone, and refining the results for precise geographic mapping. Third, we apply calibration methods to align confidence scores with IoU and explore saliency maps for feature explainability. Though optimized for palms, PRISM is adaptable for identifying other natural objects, such as eastern white pines. Future work will explore transfer learning for lower-resolution datasets (0.5 to 1m).",

Accurate segmentation facilitates environmental impact assessments, timely interventions, and compliance with safety standards. However, existing models often face high computational demands and limited adaptability to diverse smoke appearances, restricting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these issues, we introduce SmokeNet, a novel deep learning architecture that leverages multiscale convolutions and multiview linear attention mechanisms combined with layer-specific loss functions to handle the complex dynamics of diverse smoke plumes, ensuring efficient and accurate segmentation across varied environments. Additionally, we evaluate SmokeNet's performance and versatility using four datasets, including our quarry blast smoke dataset made available to the community. The results demonstrate that SmokeNet maintains a favorable balance between computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy, making it suitable for deployment in environmental monitoring and safety management systems. By contributing a new dataset and offering an efficient segmentation model, SmokeNet advances smoke segmentation capabilities in diverse and challenging environments.",
