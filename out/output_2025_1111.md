**Abstract:**  Recent advancements in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced audio-driven portrait animation. However, current methods still suffer from flickering, identity drift, and poor audio-visual synchronization. These issues primarily stem from entangled appearance-motion representations and unstable inference strategies. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ConsistTalk}, a novel intensity-controllable and temporally consistent talking head generation framework with diffusion noise search inference. First, we propose \textbf{an optical flow-guided temporal module (OFT)} that decouples motion features from static appearance by leveraging facial optical flow, thereby reducing visual flicker and improving temporal consistency. Second, we present an \textbf{Audio-to-Intensity (A2I) model} obtained through multimodal teacher-student knowledge distillation. By transforming audio and facial velocity features into a frame-wise intensity sequence, the A2I model enables joint modeling of audio and visual motion, resulting in more natural dynamics. This further enables fine-grained, frame-wise control of motion dynamics while maintaining tight audio-visual synchronization. Third, we introduce a \textbf{diffusion noise initialization strategy (IC-Init)}. By enforcing explicit constraints on background coherence and motion continuity during inference-time noise search, we achieve better identity preservation and refine motion dynamics compared to the current autoregressive strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistTalk significantly outperforms prior methods in reducing flicker, preserving identity, and delivering temporally stable, high-fidelity talking head videos.

## 1. [CoMA: Complementary Masking and Hierarchical Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention in a Unified Pre-training Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05929) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.05929
**Authors:** Jiaxuan Li, Qing Xu, Xiangjian He, Ziyu Liu, Chang Xing, Zhen Chen, Daokun Zhang, Rong Qu, Chang Wen Chen

**Abstract:**  Masked Autoencoders (MAE) achieve self-supervised learning of image representations by randomly removing a portion of visual tokens and reconstructing the original image as a pretext task, thereby significantly enhancing pretraining efficiency and yielding excellent adaptability across downstream tasks. However, MAE and other MAE-style paradigms that adopt random masking generally require more pre-training epochs to maintain adaptability. Meanwhile, ViT in MAE suffers from inefficient parameter use due to fixed spatial resolution across layers. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Complementary Masked Autoencoders (CoMA), which employ a complementary masking strategy to ensure uniform sampling across all pixels, thereby improving effective learning of all features and enhancing the model's adaptability. Furthermore, we introduce DyViT, a hierarchical vision transformer that employs a Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention (DM-MSA), significantly reducing the parameters and FLOPs while improving fine-grained feature learning. Pre-trained on ImageNet-1K with CoMA, DyViT matches the downstream performance of MAE using only 12% of the pre-training epochs, demonstrating more effective learning. It also attains a 10% reduction in pre-training time per epoch, further underscoring its superior pre-training efficiency.

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
