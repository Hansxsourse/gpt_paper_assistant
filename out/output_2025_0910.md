## 0. [Universal Few-Shot Spatial Control for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07530) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.07530
**Authors:** Kiet T. Nguyen, Chanhuyk Lee, Donggyun Kim, Dong Hoon Lee, Seunghoon Hong

**Abstract:**  Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks, achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably, when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is available at https://github.com/kietngt00/UFC.

## 1. [ScoreHOI: Physically Plausible Reconstruction of Human-Object Interaction via Score-Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07920) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.07920
**Authors:** Ao Li, Jinpeng Liu, Yixuan Zhu, Yansong Tang

**Abstract:**  Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

## 2. [DreamLifting: A Plug-in Module Lifting MV Diffusion Models for 3D Asset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07435) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.07435
**Authors:** Ze-Xin Yin, Jiaxiong Qiu, Liu Liu, Xinjie Wang, Wei Sui, Zhizhong Su, Jian Yang, Jin Xie

**Abstract:**  The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter (LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components. Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images, enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely 69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used will be publicly available via our project page: https://zx-yin.github.io/dreamlifting/.

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
