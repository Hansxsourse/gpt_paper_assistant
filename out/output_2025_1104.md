## 0. [HumanCrafter: Synergizing Generalizable Human Reconstruction and Semantic 3D Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00468) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.00468
**Authors:** Panwang Pan, Tingting Shen, Chenxin Li, Yunlong Lin, Kairun Wen, Jingjing Zhao, Yixuan Yuan

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in generative models have achieved high-fidelity in 3D human reconstruction, yet their utility for specific tasks (e.g., human 3D segmentation) remains constrained. We propose HumanCrafter, a unified framework that enables the joint modeling of appearance and human-part semantics from a single image in a feed-forward manner. Specifically, we integrate human geometric priors in the reconstruction stage and self-supervised semantic priors in the segmentation stage. To address labeled 3D human datasets scarcity, we further develop an interactive annotation procedure for generating high-quality data-label pairs. Our pixel-aligned aggregation enables cross-task synergy, while the multi-task objective simultaneously optimizes texture modeling fidelity and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HumanCrafter surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both 3D human-part segmentation and 3D human reconstruction from a single image.

## 1. [Wave-Particle (Continuous-Discrete) Dualistic Visual Tokenization for Unified Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01593) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.01593
**Authors:** Yizhu Chen, Chen Ju, Zhicheng Wang, Shuai Xiao, Xu Chen, Jinsong Lan, Xiaoyong Zhu, Ying Chen

**Abstract:**  The unification of understanding and generation within a single multi-modal large model (MLLM) remains one significant challenge, largely due to the dichotomy between continuous and discrete visual tokenizations. Continuous tokenizer (CT) achieves strong performance by bridging multiple independently-trained understanding modules and generation modules, but suffers from complex multi-stage pipelines and substantial engineering overhead. Conversely, discrete tokenizers (DT) offer a conceptually elegant idea by quantizing each image into a primitive, but inevitably leading to information loss and performance degradation. To resolve this tension, we question the binary choice between CT and DT, inspired by the wave-particle duality of light, and propose the Continuous-Discrete Dualistic Visual Tokenizer (CDD-VT). We treat visual data as a flexible composition of image primitives derived from quantized codebooks, with the crucial insight that the primitive number assigned to each visual sample is adaptively determined according to its complexity: simple instances use a few primitives, emulating discrete tokenization, while complex instances use many, approximating continuous tokenization. Two core components are designed: Diverse Quantitative Primitives, which encourage primitives orthogonality to better populate information space, and Dynamic Primitive Allocator, which assesses sample complexity to determine the optimal set of primitives. Extensive experiments on reconstruction, retrieval and classification show that CDD-VT achieves superior performance over to specialized CT and DT, effectively getting strong result within a concise and scalable MLLM.

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
