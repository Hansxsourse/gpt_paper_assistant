**ArXiv ID:** 2508.11952
**Authors:** Yueming Xu, Jiahui Zhang, Ze Huang, Yurui Chen, Yanpeng Zhou, Zhenyu Chen, Yu-Jie Yuan, Pengxiang Xia, Guowei Huang, Xinyue Cai, Zhongang Qi, Xingyue Quan, Jianye Hao, Hang Xu, Li Zhang

**Abstract:**  Despite the impressive progress on understanding and generating images shown by the recent unified architectures, the integration of 3D tasks remains challenging and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce UniUGG, the first unified understanding and generation framework for 3D modalities. Our unified framework employs an LLM to comprehend and decode sentences and 3D representations. At its core, we propose a spatial decoder leveraging a latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D representations. This allows for the generation and imagination of 3D scenes based on a reference image and an arbitrary view transformation, while remaining supports for spatial visual question answering (VQA) tasks. Additionally, we propose a geometric-semantic learning strategy to pretrain the vision encoder. This design jointly captures the input's semantic and geometric cues, enhancing both spatial understanding and generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in visual representation, spatial understanding, and 3D generation. The source code will be released upon paper acceptance.

## 1. [EgoTwin: Dreaming Body and View in First Person](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13013) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13013
**Authors:** Jingqiao Xiu, Fangzhou Hong, Yicong Li, Mengze Li, Wentao Wang, Sirui Han, Liang Pan, Ziwei Liu

**Abstract:**  While exocentric video synthesis has achieved great progress, egocentric video generation remains largely underexplored, which requires modeling first-person view content along with camera motion patterns induced by the wearer's body movements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of joint egocentric video and human motion generation, characterized by two key challenges: 1) Viewpoint Alignment: the camera trajectory in the generated video must accurately align with the head trajectory derived from human motion; 2) Causal Interplay: the synthesized human motion must causally align with the observed visual dynamics across adjacent video frames. To address these challenges, we propose EgoTwin, a joint video-motion generation framework built on the diffusion transformer architecture. Specifically, EgoTwin introduces a head-centric motion representation that anchors the human motion to the head joint and incorporates a cybernetics-inspired interaction mechanism that explicitly captures the causal interplay between video and motion within attention operations. For comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale real-world dataset of synchronized text-video-motion triplets and design novel metrics to assess video-motion consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the EgoTwin framework.

## 2. [DMS:Diffusion-Based Multi-Baseline Stereo Generation for Improving Self-Supervised Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13091) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13091
**Authors:** Zihua Liu, Yizhou Li, Songyan Zhang, Masatoshi Okutomi

**Abstract:**  While supervised stereo matching and monocular depth estimation have advanced significantly with learning-based algorithms, self-supervised methods using stereo images as supervision signals have received relatively less focus and require further investigation. A primary challenge arises from ambiguity introduced during photometric reconstruction, particularly due to missing corresponding pixels in ill-posed regions of the target view, such as occlusions and out-of-frame areas. To address this and establish explicit photometric correspondences, we propose DMS, a model-agnostic approach that utilizes geometric priors from diffusion models to synthesize novel views along the epipolar direction, guided by directional prompts. Specifically, we finetune a Stable Diffusion model to simulate perspectives at key positions: left-left view shifted from the left camera, right-right view shifted from the right camera, along with an additional novel view between the left and right cameras. These synthesized views supplement occluded pixels, enabling explicit photometric reconstruction. Our proposed DMS is a cost-free, ''plug-and-play'' method that seamlessly enhances self-supervised stereo matching and monocular depth estimation, and relies solely on unlabeled stereo image pairs for both training and synthesizing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with up to 35% outlier reduction and state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
