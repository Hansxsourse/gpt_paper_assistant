## 0. [MoVieDrive: Multi-Modal Multi-View Urban Scene Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14327) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.14327
**Authors:** Guile Wu, David Huang, Dongfeng Bai, Bingbing Liu

**Abstract:**  Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 closely as it introduces a unified diffusion transformer model for multi-modal video generation, including semantic maps.

**Abstract:**  Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However, balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for dense prediction.   FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network (Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images. This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands, which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.   We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets, achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 closely as it proposes a diffusion-driven framework for multiple tasks including semantic segmentation and depth estimation.

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
