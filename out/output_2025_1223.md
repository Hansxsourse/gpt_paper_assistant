**Abstract:**  Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have opened new possibilities for controllable video editing, yet realistic video object insertion (VOI) remains challenging due to limited 4D scene understanding and inadequate handling of occlusion and lighting effects. We present InsertAnywhere, a new VOI framework that achieves geometrically consistent object placement and appearance-faithful video synthesis. Our method begins with a 4D aware mask generation module that reconstructs the scene geometry and propagates user specified object placement across frames while maintaining temporal coherence and occlusion consistency. Building upon this spatial foundation, we extend a diffusion based video generation model to jointly synthesize the inserted object and its surrounding local variations such as illumination and shading. To enable supervised training, we introduce ROSE++, an illumination aware synthetic dataset constructed by transforming the ROSE object removal dataset into triplets of object removed video, object present video, and a VLM generated reference image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework produces geometrically plausible and visually coherent object insertions across diverse real world scenarios, significantly outperforming existing research and commercial models.

## 1. [DESSERT: Diffusion-based Event-driven Single-frame Synthesis via Residual Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17323) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.17323
**Authors:** Jiyun Kong, Jun-Hyuk Kim, Jong-Seok Lee

**Abstract:**  Video frame prediction extrapolates future frames from previous frames, but suffers from prediction errors in dynamic scenes due to the lack of information about the next frame. Event cameras address this limitation by capturing per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution. Prior research on event-based video frame prediction has leveraged motion information from event data, often by predicting event-based optical flow and reconstructing frames via pixel warping. However, such approaches introduce holes and blurring when pixel displacement is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we propose DESSERT, a diffusion-based event-driven single-frame synthesis framework via residual training. Leveraging a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, our method is trained on inter-frame residuals to ensure temporal consistency. The training pipeline consists of two stages: (1) an Event-to-Residual Alignment Variational Autoencoder (ER-VAE) that aligns the event frame between anchor and target frames with the corresponding residual, and (2) a diffusion model that denoises the residual latent conditioned on event data. Furthermore, we introduce Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT) augmentation, which improves robustness by training on frame segments of varying temporal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing event-based reconstruction, image-based video frame prediction, event-based video frame prediction, and one-sided event-based video frame interpolation methods, producing sharper and more temporally consistent frame synthesis.

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
