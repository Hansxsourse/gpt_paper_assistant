## 0. [UniAVGen: Unified Audio and Video Generation with Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03334) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.03334
**Authors:** Guozhen Zhang, Zixiang Zhou, Teng Hu, Ziqiao Peng, Youliang Zhang, Yi Chen, Yuan Zhou, Qinglin Lu, Limin Wang

**Abstract:**  Due to the lack of effective cross-modal modeling, existing open-source audio-video generation methods often exhibit compromised lip synchronization and insufficient semantic consistency. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose UniAVGen, a unified framework for joint audio and video generation. UniAVGen is anchored in a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture, incorporating two parallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to build a cohesive cross-modal latent space. At its heart lies an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism, which enables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention, thus ensuring precise spatiotemporal synchronization and semantic consistency. Furthermore, this cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module, which dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To enhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly amplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint synthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks within a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation, video-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive experiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M), UniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre consistency, and emotion consistency.

## 1. [Diffusion-Guided Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing for Endoscopic Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03219) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.03219
**Authors:** Pengyu Jie, Wanquan Liu, Rui He, Yihui Wen, Deyu Meng, Chenqiang Gao

**Abstract:**  Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or generative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield soft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but, when trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask conditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired, diffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real image, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is used as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which mixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard mask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly bridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging diversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned with real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the mixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually re-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias. Across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC 2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and consistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive re-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

## 2. [QG-CoC: Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions for Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03206) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.03206
**Authors:** Kuei-Chun Kao, Hsu Tzu-Yin, Yunqi Hong, Ruochen Wang, Cho-Jui Hsieh

**Abstract:**  Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings, we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions (QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.

## 3. [Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization for Inference-Efficient Model Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03245) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2511.03245
**Authors:** Liwei Luo, Shuaitengyuan Li, Dongwei Ren, Qilong Wang, Pengfei Zhu, Qinghua Hu

**Abstract:**  Recently, remarkable progress has been made in large-scale pre-trained model tuning, and inference efficiency is becoming more crucial for practical deployment. Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when cooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a straightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key challenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level fundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level discriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we propose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively decouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative ability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a lightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional decomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order statistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance their discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor architecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss weights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial training phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of discriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of early stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability towards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively decouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms of architecture design and model optimization. Experiments across various datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms its counterparts when reducing computational cost.

## 4. [Generative Hints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02933) <a id="link4"></a>

**Authors:** Andy Dimnaku, Abdullah Yusuf Kavrano\u{g}lu, Yaser Abu-Mostafa

**Abstract:**  Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and mitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties, such as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78% top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray dataset.

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
