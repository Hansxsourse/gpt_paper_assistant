**Authors:** Salah Eddine Bekhouche, Gaby Maroun, Fadi Dornaika, Abdenour Hadid

**Abstract:**  Medical image segmentation is crucial for many healthcare tasks, including disease diagnosis and treatment planning. One key area is the segmentation of skin lesions, which is vital for diagnosing skin cancer and monitoring patients. In this context, this paper introduces SegDT, a new segmentation model based on diffusion transformer (DiT). SegDT is designed to work on low-cost hardware and incorporates Rectified Flow, which improves the generation quality at reduced inference steps and maintains the flexibility of standard diffusion models. Our method is evaluated on three benchmarking datasets and compared against several existing works, achieving state-of-the-art results while maintaining fast inference speeds. This makes the proposed model appealing for real-world medical applications. This work advances the performance and capabilities of deep learning models in medical image analysis, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostic tools for healthcare professionals. The code is made publicly available at \href{https://github.com/Bekhouche/SegDT}{GitHub}.

## 1. [Paired Image Generation with Diffusion-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14833) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.14833
**Authors:** Haoxuan Zhang, Wenju Cui, Yuzhu Cao, Tao Tan, Jie Liu, Yunsong Peng, Jian Zheng

**Abstract:**  The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions, which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges. First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second, existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method. The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions. Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.

## 2. [SegQuant: A Semantics-Aware and Generalizable Quantization Framework for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14811) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.14811
**Authors:** Jiaji Zhang, Ruichao Sun, Hailiang Zhao, Jiaju Wu, Peng Chen, Hao Li, Xinkui Zhao, Kingsum Chow, Gang Xiong, Lin Ye, Shuiguang Deng

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities but are computationally intensive, posing significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments. Quantization offers an effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However, existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations, which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream deployment tools.

## 3. [SeC: Advancing Complex Video Object Segmentation via Progressive Concept Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15852) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.15852
**Authors:** Zhixiong Zhang, Shuangrui Ding, Xiaoyi Dong, Songxin He, Jianfan Lin, Junsong Tang, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang

**Abstract:**  Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring models to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap, we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames, constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames, realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching, dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160 manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS, establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.

## 4. [Distilling Parallel Gradients for Fast ODE Solvers of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14797) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.14797
**Authors:** Beier Zhu, Ruoyu Wang, Tong Zhao, Hanwang Zhang, Chi Zhang

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature. Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face image quality degradation under a low-latency budget. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as \ours), a novel ODE solver that mitigates truncation errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each ODE step. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling.   Our method optimizes a small set of learnable parameters in a distillation fashion, ensuring minimal training overhead.   In addition, our method can serve as a plugin to improve existing ODE samplers. Extensive experiments on various image synthesis benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our \ours~in achieving high-quality and low-latency sampling. For example, at the same latency level of 5 NFE, EPD achieves an FID of 4.47 on CIFAR-10, 7.97 on FFHQ, 8.17 on ImageNet, and 8.26 on LSUN Bedroom, surpassing existing learning-based solvers by a significant margin. Codes are available in https://github.com/BeierZhu/EPD.

## 5. [Exploring Scalable Unified Modeling for General Low-Level Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14801) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.14801
**Authors:** Xiangyu Chen, Kaiwen Zhu, Yuandong Pu, Shuo Cao, Xiaohui Li, Wenlong Zhang, Yihao Liu, Yu Qiao, Jiantao Zhou, Chao Dong

**Abstract:**  Low-level vision involves a wide spectrum of tasks, including image restoration, enhancement, stylization, and feature extraction, which differ significantly in both task formulation and output domains. To address the challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible integration with various architectures and effective utilization of task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity. We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization, few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general low-level vision modeling.

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
