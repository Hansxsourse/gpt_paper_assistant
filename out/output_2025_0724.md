## 0. [EndoGen: Conditional Autoregressive Endoscopic Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17388) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.17388
**Authors:** Xinyu Liu, Hengyu Liu, Cheng Wang, Tianming Liu, Yixuan Yuan

**Abstract:**  Endoscopic video generation is crucial for advancing medical imaging and enhancing diagnostic capabilities. However, prior efforts in this field have either focused on static images, lacking the dynamic context required for practical applications, or have relied on unconditional generation that fails to provide meaningful references for clinicians. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework, namely EndoGen. Specifically, we build an autoregressive model with a tailored Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy. It reformulates the learning of generating multiple frames as a grid-based image generation pattern, which effectively capitalizes the inherent global dependency modeling capabilities of autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we propose a Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism, which enhances the model's ability to produce rich and diverse content by selectively focusing on semantically meaningful regions during the generation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves the performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation.

## 1. [InvRGB+L: Inverse Rendering of Complex Scenes with Unified Color and LiDAR Reflectance Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17613) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.17613
**Authors:** Xiaoxue Chen, Bhargav Chandaka, Chih-Hao Lin, Ya-Qin Zhang, David Forsyth, Hao Zhao, Shenlong Wang

**Abstract:**  We present InvRGB+L, a novel inverse rendering model that reconstructs large, relightable, and dynamic scenes from a single RGB+LiDAR sequence. Conventional inverse graphics methods rely primarily on RGB observations and use LiDAR mainly for geometric information, often resulting in suboptimal material estimates due to visible light interference. We find that LiDAR's intensity values-captured with active illumination in a different spectral range-offer complementary cues for robust material estimation under variable lighting. Inspired by this, InvRGB+L leverages LiDAR intensity cues to overcome challenges inherent in RGB-centric inverse graphics through two key innovations: (1) a novel physics-based LiDAR shading model and (2) RGB-LiDAR material consistency losses. The model produces novel-view RGB and LiDAR renderings of urban and indoor scenes and supports relighting, night simulations, and dynamic object insertions, achieving results that surpass current state-of-the-art methods in both scene-level urban inverse rendering and LiDAR simulation.

## 2. [Monocular Semantic Scene Completion via Masked Recurrent Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17661) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.17661
**Authors:** Xuzhi Wang, Xinran Wu, Song Wang, Lingdong Kong, Ziping Zhao

**Abstract:**  Monocular Semantic Scene Completion (MSSC) aims to predict the voxel-wise occupancy and semantic category from a single-view RGB image. Existing methods adopt a single-stage framework that aims to simultaneously achieve visible region segmentation and occluded region hallucination, while also being affected by inaccurate depth estimation. Such methods often achieve suboptimal performance, especially in complex scenes. We propose a novel two-stage framework that decomposes MSSC into coarse MSSC followed by the Masked Recurrent Network. Specifically, we propose the Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent Unit (MS-GRU) which concentrates on the occupied regions by the proposed mask updating mechanism, and a sparse GRU design is proposed to reduce the computation cost. Additionally, we propose the distance attention projection to reduce projection errors by assigning different attention scores according to the distance to the observed surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed unified framework, MonoMRN, effectively supports both indoor and outdoor scenes and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUv2 and SemanticKITTI datasets. Furthermore, we conduct robustness analysis under various disturbances, highlighting the role of the Masked Recurrent Network in enhancing the model's resilience to such challenges. The source code is publicly available.

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
