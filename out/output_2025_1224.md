## 0. [UMAMI: Unifying Masked Autoregressive Models and Deterministic Rendering for View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20107) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.20107
**Authors:** Thanh-Tung Le, Tuan Pham, Tung Nguyen, Deying Kong, Xiaohui Xie, Stephan Mandt

**Abstract:**  Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to render photorealistic, 3D-consistent images of a scene from unseen camera poses given only a sparse set of posed views. Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines.

**Comment:** The paper proposes a unified framework for novel view synthesis using a hybrid approach combining deterministic and stochastic methods, which aligns with the interest in unified architectures.

## 1. [Learning to Refocus with Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19823) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2512.19823
**Authors:** SaiKiran Tedla, Zhoutong Zhang, Xuaner Zhang, Shumian Xin

**Abstract:**  Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography. Code and data are available at www.learn2refocus.github.io

**Comment:** The paper introduces a novel method for post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models, which is related to the interest in diffusion models but does not match the specific criteria.
**Relevance:** 3
**Novelty:** 5

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
