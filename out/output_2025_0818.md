## 0. [Unifying Scale-Aware Depth Prediction and Perceptual Priors for Monocular Endoscope Pose Estimation and Tissue Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11282) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.11282
**Authors:** Muzammil Khan, Enzo Kerkhof, Matteo Fusaglia, Koert Kuhlmann, Theo Ruers, Fran\c{c}oise J. Siepel

**Abstract:**  Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction significantly enhances monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by enabling accurate navigation and improved spatial awareness. However, monocular endoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges, including depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent endoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED, with ablation and comparative analyses, demonstrate the framework's robustness and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

## 1. [Reinforcing Video Reasoning Segmentation to Think Before It Segments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11538) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.11538
**Authors:** Sitong Gong, Lu Zhang, Yunzhi Zhuge, Xu Jia, Pingping Zhang, Huchuan Lu

**Abstract:**  Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects in videos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent and temporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models (LVLMs) to encode object semantics into  tokens for mask prediction. However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference and suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawing inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding, yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS), while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and model weights will be available at Veason-R1.

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
