## 0. [DiffOSeg: Omni Medical Image Segmentation via Multi-Expert Collaboration Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13087) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.13087
**Authors:** Han Zhang, Xiangde Luo, Yong Chen, Kang Li

**Abstract:**  Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic ``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven (reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.

## 1. [Taming Diffusion Transformer for Real-Time Mobile Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13343) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.13343
**Authors:** Yushu Wu, Yanyu Li, Anil Kag, Ivan Skorokhodov, Willi Menapace, Ke Ma, Arpit Sahni, Ju Hu, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Dhritiman Sagar, Yanzhi Wang, Sergey Tulyakov

**Abstract:**  Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on mobile devices.

## 2. [LoViC: Efficient Long Video Generation with Context Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12952) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.12952
**Authors:** Jiaxiu Jiang, Wenbo Li, Jingjing Ren, Yuping Qiu, Yong Guo, Xiaogang Xu, Han Wu, Wangmeng Zuo

**Abstract:**  Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

## 3. [Differential-informed Sample Selection Accelerates Multimodal Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12998) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.12998
**Authors:** Zihua Zhao, Feng Hong, Mengxi Chen, Pengyi Chen, Benyuan Liu, Jiangchao Yao, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang

**Abstract:**  The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection (DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over current state-of-the-art methods.

## 4. [Diffuman4D: 4D Consistent Human View Synthesis from Sparse-View Videos with Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13344) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.13344
**Authors:** Yudong Jin, Sida Peng, Xuan Wang, Tao Xie, Zhen Xu, Yifan Yang, Yujun Shen, Hujun Bao, Xiaowei Zhou

**Abstract:**  This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

## 5. [AnyCap Project: A Unified Framework, Dataset, and Benchmark for Controllable Omni-modal Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12841) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.12841
**Authors:** Yiming Ren, Zhiqiang Lin, Yu Li, Gao Meng, Weiyun Wang, Junjie Wang, Zicheng Lin, Jifeng Dai, Yujiu Yang, Wenhai Wang, Ruihang Chu

**Abstract:**  Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities, 28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

## 6. [Local Representative Token Guided Merging for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12771) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.12771
**Authors:** Min-Jeong Lee, Hee-Dong Kim, Seong-Whan Lee

**Abstract:**  Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image, but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time. We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality and computational efficiency.

## 7. [FashionPose: Text to Pose to Relight Image Generation for Personalized Fashion Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13311) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.13311
**Authors:** Chuancheng Shi, Yixiang Chen, Burong Lei, Jichao Chen

**Abstract:**  Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and lighting conditions. Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person images, and finally applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by the same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment rendering, and flexible lighting control. Experiments demonstrate fine-grained pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, providing a practical solution for personalized virtual fashion display.

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
