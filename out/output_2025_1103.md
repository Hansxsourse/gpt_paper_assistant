## 0. [Dual-Stream Diffusion for World-Model Augmented Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27607) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.27607
**Authors:** John Won, Kyungmin Lee, Huiwon Jang, Dongyoung Kim, Jinwoo Shin

**Abstract:**  Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this, we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods, while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by 13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

## 1. [SYNAPSE-Net: A Unified Framework with Lesion-Aware Hierarchical Gating for Robust Segmentation of Heterogeneous Brain Lesions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26961) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.26961
**Authors:** Md. Mehedi Hassan, Shafqat Alam, Shahriar Ahmed Seam, Maruf Ahmed

**Abstract:**  Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022 Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation. The source code and the pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/mubid-01/SYNAPSE-Net-pre.

## 2. [Phased DMD: Few-step Distribution Matching Distillation via Score Matching within Subintervals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27684) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.27684
**Authors:** Xiangyu Fan, Zesong Qiu, Zhuguanyu Wu, Fanzhou Wang, Zhiqian Lin, Tianxiang Ren, Dahua Lin, Ruihao Gong, Lei Yang

**Abstract:**  Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However, limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency. While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative capabilities. We will release our code and models.

## 3. [E-MMDiT: Revisiting Multimodal Diffusion Transformer Design for Fast Image Synthesis under Limited Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27135) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.27135
**Authors:** Tong Shen, Jingai Yu, Dong Zhou, Dong Li, Emad Barsoum

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention (ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks. Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes to democratization of generative AI models.

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
