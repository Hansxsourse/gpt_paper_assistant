## 0. [Stable Part Diffusion 4D: Multi-View RGB and Kinematic Parts Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10687) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.10687
**Authors:** Hao Zhang, Chun-Han Yao, Simon Donn\'e, Narendra Ahuja, Varun Jampani

**Abstract:**  We present Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D), a framework for generating paired RGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs. Unlike conventional part segmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns to produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object articulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch diffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part segmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different part counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks to continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to share the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to be recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion Fusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a contrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of part predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted to 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few manual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K, a curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from Objaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part video sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse scenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare articulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream animation and motion-related tasks.

## 1. [Multi-Task Diffusion Approach For Prediction of Glioma Tumor Progression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10824) <a id="link1"></a>

**Authors:** Aghiles Kebaili, Romain Modzelewski, J\'er\^ome Lapuyade-Lahorgue, Maxime Fontanilles, S\'ebastien Thureau, Su Ruan

**Abstract:**  Glioma, an aggressive brain malignancy characterized by rapid progression and its poor prognosis, poses significant challenges for accurate evolution prediction. These challenges are exacerbated by sparse, irregularly acquired longitudinal MRI data in clinical practice, where incomplete follow-up sequences create data imbalances and make reliable modeling difficult. In this paper, we present a multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic, pixel-wise prediction of glioma progression. The model simultaneously generates future FLAIR sequences at any chosen time point and estimates spatial probabilistic tumor evolution maps derived using signed distance fields (SDFs), allowing uncertainty quantification. To capture temporal dynamics of tumor evolution across arbitrary intervals, we integrate a pretrained deformation module that models inter-scan changes using deformation fields. Regarding the common clinical limitation of data scarcity, we implement a targeted augmentation pipeline that synthesizes complete sequences of three follow-up scans and imputes missing MRI modalities from available patient studies, improving the stability and accuracy of predictive models. Based on merely two follow-up scans at earlier timepoints, our framework produces flexible time-depending probability maps, enabling clinicians to interrogate tumor progression risks at any future temporal milestone. We further introduce a radiotherapy-weighted focal loss term that leverages radiation dose maps, as these highlight regions of greater clinical importance during model training. The proposed method was trained on a public dataset and evaluated on an internal private dataset, achieving promising results in both cases

## 2. [Filling the Gaps: A Multitask Hybrid Multiscale Generative Framework for Missing Modality in Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11102) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.11102
**Authors:** Nhi Kieu, Kien Nguyen, Arnold Wiliem, Clinton Fookes, Sridha Sridharan

**Abstract:**  Multimodal learning has shown significant performance boost compared to ordinary unimodal models across various domains. However, in real-world scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models' operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness (HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3) Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet, outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and Potsdam). Source code is made available.

## 3. [SMILE: A Super-resolution Guided Multi-task Learning Method for Hyperspectral Unmixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11093) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.11093
**Authors:** Ruiying Li, Bin Pan, Qiaoying Qu, Xia Xu, Zhenwei Shi

**Abstract:**  The performance of hyperspectral unmixing may be constrained by low spatial resolution, which can be enhanced using super-resolution in a multitask learning way. However, integrating super-resolution and unmixing directly may suffer two challenges: Task affinity is not verified, and the convergence of unmixing is not guaranteed. To address the above issues, in this paper, we provide theoretical analysis and propose super-resolution guided multi-task learning method for hyperspectral unmixing (SMILE). The provided theoretical analysis validates feasibility of multitask learning way and verifies task affinity, which consists of relationship and existence theorems by proving the positive guidance of super-resolution. The proposed framework generalizes positive information from super-resolution to unmixing by learning both shared and specific representations. Moreover, to guarantee the convergence, we provide the accessibility theorem by proving the optimal solution of unmixing. The major contributions of SMILE include providing progressive theoretical support, and designing a new framework for unmixing under the guidance of super-resolution. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have substantiate the usefulness of our work.

## Paper selection prompt
Unified Image/Video Generation and Segmentation

Relevant: Papers that propose architectures or frameworks where image (or video) generation and semantic (or instance) segmentation are learned jointly or in a unified pipeline. Typically these works will explicitly describe a single model (e.g., a GAN, VAE, diffusion network, or transformer) that outputs both RGB pixels and segmentation maps for images or frames, or that uses segmentation information to guide generation. Look for titles or abstracts mentioning “joint generation and segmentation,” “multi-task generative segmentation,” “co-learning of synthesis and masks,” or “segmentation-aware generation.”

Not relevant: Papers that address generation or segmentation in isolation (e.g., a standard GAN paper that does not incorporate segmentation, or a segmentation network that does not produce novel images). Also exclude works where segmentation is merely an auxiliary loss without producing a full segmentation map (e.g., classification-based saliency or attention modules that do not yield a full semantic mask).

Unified Diffusion Models (Multi-Task: Low-Level Vision, Image Generation, Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Surface Normals, etc.)

Relevant: Papers that introduce diffusion (or score-based) models designed to handle multiple vision tasks under a single architecture or training regime. These should explicitly mention training a diffusion backbone (or shared denoiser) and then switching heads (or prompts) to perform tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, unconditional/conditional generation, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, or surface normal prediction. Emphasis is on works that present a unified denoising framework (e.g., one U-Net or transformer backbone) with modular output branches or conditioning mechanisms for each task.

Not relevant: Diffusion papers that focus exclusively on one task (e.g., super-resolution only, or generation only). Also exclude works on diffusion in non-vision domains (e.g., text or audio), or papers that merely compare diffusion against other methods without proposing a multi-task, shared-diffusion backbone. If a paper briefly mentions a secondary task without truly integrating it into a unified training objective, it should be omitted.

Image Matting

Relevant: Papers that specifically target the problem of predicting a high-quality alpha matte for foreground extraction in still images. Look for deep learning–based matting networks (e.g., encoder–decoder architectures, refinement modules), novel loss functions tailored to alpha prediction, new matting datasets, or techniques that leverage trimaps, natural image priors, or auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) to improve matting accuracy.

Not relevant: Papers that perform general image segmentation (semantic or instance) but do not explicitly address alpha matting. Also exclude works that use matting as a subroutine in another pipeline (e.g., for portrait editing in a larger application) without proposing a novel matting algorithm or matting-specific contributions.

Video Matting

Relevant: Papers devoted to extracting alpha mattes for moving subjects in video, emphasizing temporal consistency, efficient propagation of alpha masks between frames, or the integration of motion cues (optical flow, temporal attention) into the matting network. These works often propose recurrent or 3D-CNN architectures, leverage per-frame trimaps plus propagation strategies, or introduce new benchmarks for video matting.

Not relevant: Works on video segmentation or background subtraction that do not explicitly model alpha mattes (i.e., they produce binary masks or bounding boxes, not soft alpha layers). Also exclude papers that apply image matting frame by frame without addressing temporal coherence or motion-specific challenges.

In suggesting papers based on the above topics, remember that your friend enjoys research on statistical machine learning and generative modeling in computer vision, especially methods that reveal surprising empirical findings or employ clever statistical tricks. He prefers papers proposing fundamentally new architectures or unified frameworks over those focused primarily on applications to specific datasets or domains.
