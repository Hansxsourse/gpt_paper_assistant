 1. New methodological improvements to spatial understanding, spatial intelligence on embodied agents;
    - Not relevant: papers about adaptation to some task. Simply following instructions or inputs are not sufficient.
 2. Shows new VLLMs (visual large language models) or MLLMs (multi-modal large language models)
    - Relevant: new powerful end-to-end tuning MLLMs or VLLMs
    - Not relevant: specific tasks
 3. Embodied AI papers on buliding new benchmark (simulator related) or new methods. These papers should focus on novel angles that previous work ignored.

 In suggesting papers to your friend, remember that he enjoys papers on computer vision and machine learning, and generative modeling in multi-modal learning.
 Your friend also likes learning about surprising empirical or insightful results in vision-language models or embodied AI, as well as clever statistical tricks.
 He does not want to read papers that are about primarily applications of methods to specific domains.
