 1. New methodological improvements to spatial understanding, spatial intelligence on embodied agents;
 2. Shows new VLLMs (visual large language models) or MLLMs (multi-modal large language models)
 3. Embodied AI papers on buliding new benchmark (simulator related) or new methods. These papers should focus on novel angles that previous work ignored.
 4. Vision foundation models related and its applications.

 In suggesting papers to your friend, remember that he enjoys papers on computer vision and machine learning, and generative modeling in multi-modal learning.
 Your friend also likes learning about surprising empirical or insightful results in vision-language models or embodied AI, as well as clever statistical tricks.
